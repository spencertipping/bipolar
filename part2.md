# Part 2: strategy and results
I suspect I have a few major issues that require active intervention:

1. Under-methylation of homocysteine due to MTHFR (and coffee+alcohol probably didn't help)
2. Lithium deficiency
3. General anxiety for a variety of reasons

There are multiple ways to deal with these problems. I chose supplementation because it's cheap, reasonably safe, and easy to do controlled experiments. Then I know what I'm doing for longer-run changes like lifestyle and diet.


## Current medication routine
I've been on this since about May/June 2020, so eight months as of this writing. The results have been fantastic. I'm alert, focused, consistently motivated, and low-anxiety almost all the time -- none of which I thought I would ever be able to achieve.

All of this is available over the counter; I don't use prescription medications or have a primary care physician (or even health insurance).

+ Morning
  + Neurotransmitter regulation
    + 20mg lithium as lithium aspartate
    + 96mg magnesium via 1333mg magnesium threonate
  + Anxiolytics
    + 500mg theanine
    + 600mg ashwagandha
  + Stimulants
    + 10g tyrosine
    + 12-18g yerba mate tea
    + 6g ginkgo biloba + 6g bacopa monnieri + 6g gotu kola + 6g mint + 1g ginger root tea
  + Methylation
    + 15mg-20mg methylfolate
    + 2.5mg methyl-B12
    + 400mg riboflavin
  + Antioxidants and glutathione precursors
    + 2400mg long-release NAC
    + 10-20g collagen peptides
    + 1500mg vitamin C
  + Thyroid support
    + 225mcg iodine as potassium iodide
+ Evening
  + 20mg lithium aspartate
  + 3g taurine (as magnesium taurate)
  + 1000mg tryptophan peptides
  + B-vitamin complex
  + Vitamin E
  + 1000mg theanine
+ Weekly
  + Selenium

**NOTE:** I suspect some of my dosages are above what's necessary. I've gotten great results, but I haven't tuned any of this for efficiency yet and it's a bit of a work in progress. If you know of things I should improve, please let me know.

I also usually eat eggs and fish for breakfast, usually four eggs and 4-6oz of tuna or salmon. The choline isn't a problem, although eggs and fish keep me awake and I can't supplement alpha-GPC, citicholine, or ALA without getting really depressed.

I still have minor mood and energy cycling throughout the year, but nothing like before. Sometimes I'll try to course-correct; here are some of the options I'll use (usually a subset, not all of them):

+ If I've been sick or feel really bad (uncommon):
  + 10g glutamine (excitotoxicity risk)
  + 5-10-20mg DHEA (steroid-related risks)
+ If I'm depressed or sluggish (uncommon, maybe 1-3 days/quarter)
  + more ginkgo+bacopa tea
  + +5-10mg methylfolate
  + +48mg magnesium threonate
  + +5g tyrosine
+ If I'm anxious or jittery (more common, maybe 7-10 days/quarter)
  + Decrease tyrosine and collagen
  + +500-1000mg theanine as needed
  + +600mg ashwagandha
  + +3-5g taurine (without magnesium)
  + +500mg tryptophan peptides
  + +5-10mg methylfolate
  + +2.5mg methyl-B12


## Rationale, insofar as one exists
There are a few broad categories of things going on in the meds above.

First, trace metals used to regulate neurotransmitters. Although it isn't the medical view, I believe lithium to be an essential mineral, similar to magnesium or potassium. My goal is to make sure that I have enough of all of these even under stress, which I assume will happen more than it would for most people since I probably retain some underlying bipolar cycling. Overdoing lithium or magnesium can cause problems, but there are a lot of early warning signs for both. I consider them to be safe to experiment with given that I know roughly what to look for.

Second, methylation and, more broadly, antioxidants. The Hcy->Met pathway consumes the methyl groups from methylfolate and requires (but doesn't consume) methylated B12. MTHFR mutations mean that I have an impaired folate methylation pathway -- that is, I may have adequate folate but I can't add methyl groups to it very quickly. As a result, the methionine cycle underperforms, resulting in high homocysteine.

Methylation gets a bit more complicated because methionine isn't the only thing homocysteine is used for. This is where NAC comes into the picture.
