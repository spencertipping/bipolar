# Part 2: strategy and results
I suspect I have a few major issues that require active intervention:

1. Under-methylation of homocysteine due to MTHFR (and coffee+alcohol probably didn't help)
2. Lithium deficiency
3. General anxiety for a variety of reasons

There are multiple ways to deal with these problems. I chose supplementation because it's cheap, reasonably safe, and easy to do controlled experiments. Then I know what I'm doing for longer-run changes like lifestyle and diet.

**Warning:** I'm writing this up as an example of stuff to look at, not as a "you should do this" list. I mean you probably wouldn't die if you took my list verbatim, but you might complicate things a lot, e.g. with [serotonin syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or by inducing mania from methylfolate or tyrosine. So just a heads-up: what's safe for me might not be safe for you, etc. I recommend doing your own research and not taking the advice of random internet strangers, no matter how good-looking we are. It's not our fault, we were just born that way.


## Current medication routine
I've been on this since about May/June 2020, so eight months as of this writing. The results have been fantastic. I'm alert, focused, consistently motivated, and low-anxiety almost all the time -- none of which I thought I would ever be able to achieve.

All of this is available over the counter; I don't use prescription medications or have a primary care physician (or even health insurance).

+ Morning (daily)
  + Neurotransmitter regulation
    + 20mg lithium as lithium aspartate
    + 96mg magnesium via 1333mg magnesium threonate
  + Anxiolytics
    + 500mg theanine
    + 600mg ashwagandha
  + Stimulants and brain circulation
    + 10g tyrosine
    + 12-18g yerba mate tea
    + 7g ginkgo biloba + 7g bacopa monnieri + 4g gotu kola + 5g mint + 8g ginger root tea (totally ad-hoc thing, see below)
  + Methylation
    + 15mg-20mg methylfolate
    + 2.5mg methyl-B12
    + 400mg riboflavin
  + Antioxidants and glutathione precursors
    + 2400mg long-release NAC
    + 10-20g collagen peptides
    + 1500mg vitamin C
  + Thyroid support
    + 225mcg iodine as potassium iodide
+ Evening (daily)
  + 20mg lithium aspartate
  + 3g taurine (as magnesium taurate)
  + 1000mg tryptophan peptides
  + B-vitamin complex
  + Vitamin E
  + 1000mg theanine
+ Weekly
  + Selenium

**Note:** I suspect some of my dosages are above what's necessary. I've gotten great results, but I haven't tuned any of this for efficiency yet and it's a bit of a work in progress. If you know of things I should improve, please let me know.

**Also note:** I really don't understand how riboflavin and methylation are related. It was in an article somewhere and I noticed that I can take less methylfolate when I take riboflavin too, but otherwise I don't get how it works.

I also usually eat eggs and fish for breakfast, usually four eggs and 4-6oz of tuna or salmon. Dietary choline isn't a problem, although eggs and fish keep me awake if I eat them at night and I can't supplement alpha-GPC, citicholine, or ALA without getting really depressed.

I still have minor mood and energy cycling throughout the year, but nothing like before. Sometimes I'll try to course-correct; here are some of the options I'll use (usually a subset, not all of them):

+ If I've been sick or feel really bad (uncommon):
  + 10g glutamine (excitotoxicity risk)
  + 5-10-20mg DHEA (steroid-related risks)
+ If I'm depressed or sluggish (uncommon, maybe 1-3 days/quarter)
  + more ginkgo+bacopa tea
  + +5-10mg methylfolate
  + +48mg magnesium threonate
  + +5g tyrosine
+ If I'm anxious or jittery (more common, maybe 7-10 days/quarter)
  + Decrease tyrosine and collagen
  + +500-1000mg theanine as needed
  + +600mg ashwagandha
  + +3-5g taurine (without magnesium)
  + +500mg tryptophan peptides
  + +5-10mg methylfolate
  + +2.5mg methyl-B12


## Rationale, insofar as one exists
There are a few broad categories of things going on in the meds above.

First, trace metals used to regulate neurotransmitters. Although it isn't the medical view, I believe lithium to be an essential mineral, similar to magnesium or potassium. My goal is to make sure that I have enough of all of these even under stress, which I assume will happen more than it would for most people since I probably retain some underlying bipolar cycling. Overdoing lithium or magnesium can cause problems, but there are a lot of early warning signs for both. I consider them to be safe to experiment with given that I know roughly what to look for.

Second, methylation and, more broadly, antioxidants. The Hcy->Met pathway consumes the methyl groups from methylfolate and requires (but doesn't consume) methylated B12. MTHFR mutations mean that I have an impaired folate methylation pathway -- that is, I may have adequate folate but I can't add methyl groups to it very quickly. As a result, the methionine cycle underperforms, resulting in high homocysteine.

Methylation gets a bit more complicated because methionine isn't the only thing homocysteine is used for. This is where NAC comes into the picture.

### The woo-woo gingko herbal tea stuff
Hardly the most important thing on the list, but I should mention where this comes from and what it's about.

There are various studies that suggest ginkgo and bacopa are good for brain circulation, help memory, and are neuroprotective. I started at the recommended dose and then multiplied it by 10 because I like to live dangerously (let's be honest: when "ginkgo biloba overdose" turns up nothing scary, that's just because people haven't tried hard enough).

Gotu kola I have no idea about. It's a traditional herb and I'm a whore for ancient nootropics, so that's about all there is to it.

The ratios aren't special. I filled a mason jar equally by volume with ginkgo, bacopa, gotu kola, and mint leaves, then put some ginger on top. Joyce took that mixture and calculated precise gram amounts so she could make it in bulk, since she drinks it too.
