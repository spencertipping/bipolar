# Part 2: background reading on neurotransmitters and metabolism
Here's a list of Wikipedia and pubmed articles I found to be most helpful when designing a treatment strategy for my bipolar symptoms. Again, not authoritative or complete, just some starting points I used to figure things out.


## The five-minute version
If you don't have time to read everything, here's (in my opinion) the most important stuff to know about:

+ [MTHFR enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase), the methionine cycle, and hyperhomocysteinemia -- common failure points if you have an MTHFR mutation (can be addressed with methylfolate, but read more before doing this long-term)
+ [Lithium aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aspartate), an OTC form of lithium that, IMO, is safe and everyone should take at 5mg/day or more (I take 40mg/day)
+ [Glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione): "the master antioxidant" (made from glutamate + glycine + cysteine), limited by cysteine availability
+ [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine): the amino acid precursor to dopamine, melanin, and thyroid hormone -- I take 10g/day, which is a lot
+ [This page about alcohol, GABA, and NMDA](alcohol-substitution.md), which covers what I think should be common cultural knowledge about (and alternatives to) GABA-ergic drugs like alcohol and benzos


## Lithium: trace metal for neurotransmitter regulation
I have an ax to grind here: I really think lithium is an essential trace mineral, and I think people take humongous amounts for psychiatric disorders and suffer through major side effects when smaller amounts would get a lot of the benefit. I'm not alone in suspecting these things; a number of studies have come out in support of this view.

Lithium has a far worse reputation than I think it deserves, especially in small quantities. I take 40mg/day to think more clearly and have no side effects. I suspect most people would benefit from 5mg/day, which is on the high side of what you might encounter in groundwater.

It's often prescribed in much higher doses for bipolar and other disorders; prescriptions range anywhere from 900mg-1800mg/day of lithium carbonate (~150mg-300mg of elemental lithium, if I remember right). This is why it causes problems for people. I haven't found any documented risks related to microdosing, and several articles have suggested it's neuroprotective.

+ [Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))
  + [Texas study suggesting that lithium is a trace nutrient](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1699579/)
  + [Japanese study associating trace lithium with lower suicide risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19407280/)
  + [Lithium aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aspartate), an OTC and, in my opinion, safe supplement I've used since September 2019 with no issues

**Note about initial side effects:** I got very absent-minded for a couple of weeks when I started on even a small amount of lithium (2mg/day). I also felt nauseous for about 30min after each dose.

These side effects both went away. The absent-mindedness turned out to be the feature, not a bug: I had grown accustomed to keeping track of thoughts by obsession, not by habit. Lithium prevented ideas from lingering if I wasn't thinking about them. I had to get used to this and learned to actively remember things. Now it's awesome and I would never go back: I'm much more deliberate and focused, and I never have nagging or obsessive thoughts.

Joyce reminded me that I started taking NAC shortly after starting lithium; that made a big difference. I don't know why this would be the case (glutathione deficiency maybe?), but apparently I was about to quit after the first week because I was unproductive and NAC saved the day.


## Methylation: general metabolism and oxidative stress
+ [Methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation), relevant for reducing oxidative stress if you have an MTHFR mutation (I have C677T; 23AndMe can tell you what you are)
  + [MTHFR enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase)
  + [Homocysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine), most importantly the [methionine cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine#/media/File:MTHFR_metabolism.svg)
  + [Hyperhomocysteinemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhomocysteinemia), the reason I was anxious and miserable -- ([pubmed on Hcy and alcohol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10905999/), [pubmed on Hcy and coffee/caffeine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12450889/))
+ [Oxidative stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress)
  + [ROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species): toxic byproducts of normal aerobic metabolism (e.g. homocysteine)
+ [Antioxidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant)
  + [Glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione): "the master antioxidant" (made from glutamate + glycine + cysteine and a big reason that sleep is important -- see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15472007/)
  + [Vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C)
  + [Vitamin E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E)
  + [Beta carotene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Carotene)

**Note:** homocysteine is used for multiple things in the body, including glutathione synthesis (via the trans-sulfuration pathway as an indirect cysteine source, see [this pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12631446/) for example). I supplement [NAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) as a substitute to supply cysteine in case my methylation adjustments result in too much Hcy->Met conversion.


## Thyroid: basal metabolic control
+ [Thyroid hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones)
  + [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine)
  + [Iodine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_in_biology), the rate-limiting factor behind thyroid control
  + [Hypothyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism)
  + [Hyperthyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism)
+ [TSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone): causes the thyroid to produce T3 and T4, if tyrosine and iodine are available


## NMDA receptors: up- and down-regulating neurotransmission
+ [NMDA receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor)
  + [Excitotoxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity), particularly due to [glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter))
    + [Theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine): a safe and neuroprotective glutamate antagonist found in matcha tea that I think everyone should be familiar with (I discuss it in the context of alcohol use [here](alcohol-substitution.md))
  + [GABA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid), the NMDA inhibitor (relaxant) people upregulate with alcohol and benzodiazepines
  + [GABA receptor agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor_agonist)
  + [GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor_positive_allosteric_modulator)
    + [Alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol): a bad way to upregulate GABA receptors
    + [Benzodiazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine): a scary and possibly bad way to upregulate GABA receptors
  + [GABA-B receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAB_receptor)

Glutamate and glutamine are different but related. I'll sometimes supplement 10g of glutamine if I'm sluggish after I've been sick; I think the immune system consumes glutamine. Too much and I'll start to get irritable, I imagine due to excitotoxicity.


## Monoamines: stuff that goes wrong sometimes
A lot of psychiatric medications modify these neurotransmitters directly. Because I'm doing this DIY, I prefer to be one degree removed by supplementing precursors that have a rate-limiting enzyme; for example, NDRIs (e.g. prescribed amphetamines) force higher dopamine levels, tyrosine (converted by a hydroxylase enzyme) supplies the precursor but allows the brain to downregulate tyrosine hydroxylase to maintain homeostasis.

**Note:** [Choline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline), or more precisely [acetylcholine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine), is a big deal as neurotransmitters go. I've tried supplementing it a few times and always got super depressed, so I don't know how it plays into bipolar disorder. It also isn't a monoamine so it isn't in the list here. But it should be on your mind if you're studying neurotransmitters and how to change them, I just don't know much about it beyond that.

+ [Monoamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter)
  + [Dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine): motivational salience
    + [Phenylalanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine), essential amino acid
    + [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine), nonessential amino acid derived from phenylalanine
    + [Tyrosine hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase): tyrosine -> [L-DOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA)
    + [AADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase): L-DOPA -> dopamine
    + [Dopamine beta-hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_beta-hydroxylase): dopamine -> norepinephrine
    + [NDRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor), e.g. methylphenidate (Ritalin), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and amphetamine
  + [Phenethylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine), endogeneous amphetamine-like chemicals
  + [Serotonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin): feeling good about stuff, sort of, but it's complicated
    + [Tryptophan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan)
    + [Tryptophan hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan_hydroxylase): tryptophan -> [5-HTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan)
    + [AADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase): 5-HTP -> serotonin (same as for dopamine)
    + [SSRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor)
+ [Monoamine oxidases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase)
  + [MAO-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_B), the enzyme that deactivates dopamine and phenethylamine
  + [Monoamine oxidase inhibitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor), antidepressants that deactivate MAO enzymes


## Caffeinated beverages and xanthines
Not super relevant, but I've gotten some benefit from switching to yerba mate from coffee. Different beverages have different xanthine and antioxidant profiles that can change their metabolic impact to some degree.

+ [Xanthine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine)
  + [Theobromine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine), a metabolite of caffeine that doesn't cross the BBB
  + [Caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine), theobromine plus one methyl group (crosses BBB)
  + [Theophylline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophylline)
+ Xanthine-laden beverages
  + [Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee), which contains caffeine but no other xanthines ([SO answer about this](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2872/theobromine-in-coffee))
  + [Green tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea)
  + [Yerba mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)), my favorite kind of tea, and one that includes all three xanthines
  + [Matcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha), a green tea that naturally contains [theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine) (which I think everyone should be familiar with; see the NMDA section above and [here](alcohol-substitution.md))
  + **TODO:** black and oolong teas, although I don't have a lot of experience with them aside from pu'erh

My intuition is that xanthines, and really anything that increases basal metabolic rate, will cause the body to emit more ROS and therefore increase the need for antioxidants. I suspect it also increases required methylation throughput, which may be why caffeine raises homocysteine ([pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12450889/)).
