# The making of the bipolar writeup
**Heads up:** this page has a brief description of some mindsets that lead to suicidal behavior.

**TODO:** I suspect this page is worse than I thought it was when I wrote it. I plan to re-outline and rewrite when I have time. These early passes are usually pretty bad.

Writing this was a wild ride. The goal was always to end up with a detailed postmortem, but I'm not really done medicating bipolar and probably never will be. How do you analyze a project that's still under way?

I guess you just write about it and rewrite when things change. That's what I did anyway. For every word that ended up in this repo, I probably wrote and then deleted ten more in prior revisions and attempts. This isn't the first repo, either: it's the seventh.

Beyond just shipping something, there were other considerations: what's the scope of the writeup? Who's the audience? Where's the line between saying "this would have helped me" and offering medical advice? How do I balance the importance and discomfort of difficult topics? How much of my (and by extension, Joyce's and the kids') personal life do I want to put on the internet? How do I write about mental illness without it being a huge downer?


## Scoping
Keeping this project tractably small was an effort in itself. Bipolar at work, for example, could easily become "what's up with employees and employers more broadly", which gets into the [productivity/pay gap](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) and technological automation, the pros and cons of capitalism, and so forth. It's tempting to go down that rabbit hole because social-inclusion movements have a tendency to advocate for non-capitalist economies, albeit skipping the intermediate analysis in their PR materials. I find that interesting to explore, but there are two big downsides:

1. This writeup would take even more years to finish
2. Most people interested in mental illness would not value my unqualified macroeconomic speculation very much

So finding the right boundaries involved trial and error. The error being the "delete pages of content" variety, for the most part.


## Audience and narrative style
I found this to be very difficult, especially at first.

From the beginning, I had two groups of people in mind. One was myself in early 2019: I had just figured out I had a major mental problem and hadn't done any research yet. What would I have found most useful?

The other group is people who are close to someone with mental illness and don't understand what they're looking at. [BipolarSOS on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/) is a great example of this. I wanted to provide a clear picture of what I was thinking in my more deranged moments to help bridge the empathy gap. (Which was also challenging to do; in the first iterations I'd often sound like the crazy person I was describing, which doesn't work because it isn't code-switched for normal people.)

...and speaking of code switching, I should explain the unusual narrative tone.


## Code switching and suicide prevention
**Note:** this is all speculation from my experience, so although I complain about the medical institution, it's worth noting that I'm not their entire target audience.

[Suicide in the US is rising, but calls to hotlines are not.](https://whyy.org/segments/more-people-in-crisis-doesnt-mean-more-calls-to-suicide-hotlines-why-the-disconnect/) Although there are people who have had bad experiences with suicide hotlines ([anecdata](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-suicide-hotlines-so-terrible?share=1), [anecdata](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gq47r4/the_usa_suicide_hotline_is_terrible_and_shouldnt/)), I think the fundamental problem is a lack of trust. If I call a suicide hotline and they believe I'll go through with it, I'm going to get a visit from the police and possibly be institutionalized. From my perspective, this is worse than just doing the job myself (obviously, otherwise I wouldn't be on the phone at all). So I don't call: I don't expect to be understood, and I do expect to be forced to make choices I don't want to make. So I avoid suicide hotlines because their interests are not aligned with mine.

Suppose we address the trust problem by saying that hotlines aren't allowed to intervene. So if I call in, no matter what I say about my plans for myself, I know that the police won't show up. What's the core dynamic of the negotiation?

The hotline loses leverage from this constraint, clearly. They're now walking into a hostage negotiation with no cash and no backup. However, I don't believe it's an intractable problem. Now they have to do the one thing they always should have done: they have to work with your frame of reference and show you why it's inaccurate. They have to understand where you're coming from.

Joyce and I made an internal repo, evocatively titled "don't die", of monologues I would write for myself after wanting to commit suicide. The idea being that, in the ideal case, I'd never want to die for the same reasons twice because I'd be able to talk myself out of it. We were able to classify some of my [delusional escapism](early-signs.md#costa-rica-moments) too.
