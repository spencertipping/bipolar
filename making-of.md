# The making of the bipolar writeup
**Heads up:** this page has a brief description of some mindsets that lead to suicidal behavior.

Writing this was a wild ride. The goal was always to end up with a detailed postmortem, but I'm not really done medicating bipolar and probably never will be. How do you analyze a project that's still under way?

I guess you just write about it and rewrite when things change. That's what I did anyway. For every word that ended up in this repo, I probably wrote and then deleted ten more in prior revisions and attempts. This isn't the first repo, either: it's the seventh.

Beyond just shipping something, there were other considerations: what's the scope of the writeup? Who's the audience? Where's the line between saying "this would have helped me" and offering medical advice? How do I balance the importance and discomfort of difficult topics? How much of my (and by extension, Joyce's and the kids') personal life do I want to put on the internet? How do I write about mental illness without it being a huge downer?


## Scoping
Keeping this project tractably small was an effort in itself. Bipolar at work, for example, could easily become "what's up with employees and employers more broadly", which gets into the [productivity/pay gap](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) and technological automation, the pros and cons of capitalism, and so forth. It's tempting to go down that rabbit hole because social-inclusion movements have a tendency to advocate for non-capitalist economies, albeit skipping the intermediate analysis in their PR materials. I find that interesting to explore, but there are two big downsides:

1. This writeup would take even more years to finish
2. Most people interested in mental illness would not value my unqualified macroeconomic speculation very much

So finding the right boundaries involved trial and error. The error being the "delete pages of content" variety, for the most part.


## Audience and narrative style
I found this to be very difficult, especially at first.

From the beginning, I had two groups of people in mind. One was myself in early 2019: I had just figured out I had a major mental problem and hadn't done any research yet. What would I have found most useful?

The other group is people who are close to someone with mental illness and don't understand what they're looking at. [BipolarSOS on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/) is a great example of this. I wanted to provide a clear picture of what I was thinking in my more deranged moments to help bridge the empathy gap. (Which was also challenging to do; in the first iterations I'd often sound like the crazy person I was describing, which doesn't work because it isn't code-switched for normal people.)

...and speaking of code switching, I should explain the unusual narrative tone.


## Code switching and suicide prevention
This is all speculation from my experience, so although I complain about the mecial institution, it's worth noting that I'm not their entire target audience.

Medical people are like the police in that they can come across as tone-deaf authoritarians with delusions of relevance. Suicide is a way to opt out of the orthodoxy they promote: they calmly tell you to call a hotline when you're mixed-manic, shaking from adrenaline, and drinking your way into your own wake. I'd rather go for a recreational root canal than receive impotent platitudes and a lecture on my errant ways, possibly punctuated by a visit from [America's friendliest home invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States).

(Full disclosure: I don't know what happens when you call a suicide hotline, beyond knowing that they will call the police in some cases. I've heard [mixed](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-suicide-hotlines-so-terrible?share=1) [reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gq47r4/the_usa_suicide_hotline_is_terrible_and_shouldnt/) from people who have. I haven't been to the dentist in 20 years, so I sure as shit am not gonna risk calling a random, under-trained volunteer in a [Peter-principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) bureaucracy when I'm emotionally fragile and wanting to snuff it. That's just common sense, right?)

Talking to someone who's suicidal is like showing up broke to a hostage negotiation. If you want to talk someone off the ledge, you can't pretend to have leverage and say dumb shit like "suicide is never the answer" or "[have you tried running a bath](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-suicide-hotlines-so-useless-They-claim-they-cant-give-advice-and-the-last-one-I-talked-too-dismissed-my-depression-It-just-felt-like-Id-called-up-solely-to-be-patronized-and-laughed-at/answer/Bettie-Stiletto)" (which is likely to make you an accomplice); you have to understand where they're coming from and offer a perspective they can relate to. You have to understand that their desire to commit suicide is a proxy for how they think the world feels about them. More than anything else, if you want to project real empathy, you have to understand why suicide is sometimes an option.

...which gets right into why the fuzz should never be involved, even though they save lives sometimes. We think of the interaction with suicide hotlines as happening on the phone, but it really begins _before the call is made._ How many people didn't even dial because they feared that their consent to die would be violated forcefully if they spoke to anyone? [Suicide in the US is rising, but calls to hotlines are not.](https://whyy.org/segments/more-people-in-crisis-doesnt-mean-more-calls-to-suicide-hotlines-why-the-disconnect/) If we say every unmade call is a hotline-infrastructure failure, how effective is our strategy?

And that's a big part of where this repo comes from. I want to proactively communicate that you don't have to believe life is sacred to have someone you can talk to. There's no orthodoxy requirement to have your consent respected. I want to connect with people in very deranged states of mind (well, the ones I know about) and create a path from where they are now to enough self-awareness to see how broken their neurotransmitters are, if that turns out to be the problem. That resource is absent from all the suicide-outreach materials I've found so far and I think lives are being lost because of it.

...so this project is an attempt to bridge two very different worlds. I hope it works. Please let me know if you think I can do it better.
