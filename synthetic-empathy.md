# Synthetic empathy
The world is much more forgiving towards weirdness than it used to be. I think we achieved this in two ways: first, ubiquitous information defeated provincialism; and second, social diversity required us to develop more outwardly tolerant behaviors. Of these two, I consider the first to be material progress and the second, "synthetic empathy", to be a workaround we apply when we don't understand things. Both are important, but they serve different purposes.

Synthetic empathy is a sane default only insofar as it allows us to be temporarily ignorant. We then converge to a place of genuine understanding once we educate ourselves. If we don't, we end up being burdened by politeness: the privilege of being neurotypical turns into a social debt that's never resolved. We say "he's not an asshole, he's mentally ill" when in reality he's mentally ill _and_ an asshole, and it's possible the assholery will go away once he's on the right meds. We become blind to solutions because we're focused on tolerating the problem.

I'm not proposing that we go around pointing out flaws we perceive in people we don't understand. I mean you can, but you won't have many friends. Equally important, though, I think it's important to recognize that this tolerance -- politeness, really -- is a type of distance that may or may not be constructive. I don't want my close friends to assume that because they're neurotypical they can't comment on my life. And as much as I can, I want to offer neurotypical people insight into how neurotypical people around them might view things. Not so they can project empathy better, but so they can offer more pointed and informed critique.


## Politics is to blame
...and I'm not talking about any particular side, I'm talking about politics as a lens we use to understand the world. Here's how I imagine it to have gone (with corresponding [dramatization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d67rhIzUhhk?t=52)):

> People: "We have a problem and society makes it worse!"
>
> Other people: "You guys hear that? It's _the weirdos_ again, making a problem where there isn't one. Stop being broken and everything will work!"
>
> People: "You guys are so mean about our problems! You don't know what it's like to be us! Just fix society!"
>
> Other people: "'Just fix society!' -- like society doesn't work for, like, everyone except you guys. All you guys want is attention and accommodation. Fuck right off."
>
> People: "See? This is what's wrong with the world: all these prejudiced assholes. We're never going to get anywhere with all these assholes!"

**TODO:** explain my beef with this
