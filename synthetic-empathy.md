# Synthetic empathy
**TODO:** tighten this up if I can

The world is much more forgiving towards weirdness than it used to be. I think we achieved this in two ways: first, ubiquitous information defeated provincialism; and second, social diversity required us to develop more outwardly tolerant behaviors. Of these two, I consider the first to be material progress and the second, "synthetic empathy", to be a symptom that we're still jingoistic monkeys.

Synthetic empathy is a sane default only insofar as it allows us to be temporarily ignorant. We then converge to a place of genuine understanding once we educate ourselves. If we don't, we end up being burdened by politeness: the privilege of being neurotypical turns into a social debt that's never resolved. "He's not an asshole, he's mentally ill" -- no, he's mentally ill _and_ an asshole, and it's possible the assholery will go away once he's on the right meds.

**TODO:** quantify the joint burdens of understanding and transparency
