# Integrity
Most people are stable enough that we don't tend to distinguish between a person and their characteristics. When we have to, we typically fault the person for lacking integrity: "this isn't like them" or "they're inconsistent/unpredictable". Stability allows us to model someone more accurately, which means we can make more detailed and constructive assumptions. It plays a functional role in forming predictable partnerships with people.

Bipolar or not, integrity is conditional. Everyone's neurotransmitters fluctuate in certain situations; the main difference between mood-disordered and neurotypical people is which situations cause which effects. If a situation causes neurotransmitter disruption in enough people, we create a cultural norm to prevent it from happening.

...in other words, what we perceive as sanity has nothing to do with being intrinsically stable or reasonable. It's more about having degrees of variability that culture is well-equipped to handle.
