# DIY psychiatry
Any type of DIY speculation about things like psychiatry runs the risk of being [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience). I suspect I straddle that line a little, for a few reasons:

1. Things that work for me may not work for most other people with the same apparent condition (i.e. we may have a different latent condition or genetic disposition)
2. I have different goals than many people who want to treat psychiatric disorders, particularly around risks
3. I often deliberately avoid the most effective treatments, as they tend to bypass the most homeostatic regulation mechanisms


## Quality of life vs quality of research
I have an MTHFR mutation, so a lot of my treatment focuses on preventing homocysteine buildup. This is questionable in medical science; I haven't had any bloodwork done to suggest that I have a problem with homocysteine, nor that my methylation is deficient. I felt much better after taking methylfolate once, and I have a history of relevant risk factors like coffee and alcohol use. But I didn't study this in detail; I use methylfolate because I tried it and it works _for me_ -- then I retroactively speculate about why it might work and see if it makes sense to use long-term. That isn't the scientific method, it's the "ship a fix" method; I'm not a scientist, I'm an engineer.


## "Safety first" is a conflict of interest (for me)
Anyone who knows me will be unsurprised that I have a beef.

My expectation is that doctors view me being a potato as better than me being a hyperproductive genius but having a 10% chance of suicide, and I disagree with that assessment. I value my ability to think and at some point I'm willing to roll the dice, probably more than the medical institution would like me to. That's my prerogative because I don't owe life to anyone.

What that means, though, is that I'm not necessarily going to avoid hypomania as assiduously as bipolar medication regimes tend to (despite that being the most effective way to prevent suicide, numerically speaking). In fact, I value hypomania to some extent because it helps me do some of my best work. I'd much rather be able to support consistent hypomania, have some workarounds in place for problem-mania, and avoid depression altogether even though I understand that this probably increases my risk of suicide overall. Quality of life is more important than quantity of life, to me anyway.

I'm certain that I'm not alone in this, which is why I think the medical institution should provide alternatives to the safety-first approach. Studies vary, but something like 60% of bipolar patients are medically noncompliant after two years. This is shockingly bad; if 60% of people stopped wearing seatbelts after two years, we'd ask ourselves how the hell we screwed it up so much. Bipolar is a more complicated problem, of course, but stuff like microdosing OTC lithium and [substituting GABA-ergic supplements for alcohol](alcohol-substitution.md) should be common wisdom in my opinion, especially for people with a history of mental problems.


## ...and on that point, why I'm qualified to be my psychiatrist
(Narrator: "He wasn't.")

I sometimes think about the commercials where some dude comes on and says "my life is amazing on Awesomitol; talk to your doctor and see if it's right for you." Why does this happen? Why am I recommending medications to my doctor; isn't that their job?

Here's what I understand these commercials to imply about our healthcare system.

1. Nobody runs a commercial unless they believe it will work -- and there are companies that measure ad effectiveness, so it's reasonable to assume they do work.
2. That means consumers are, at some level, writing some of their own prescriptions; i.e. doctors are ambivalent enough to let them do this.
3. Prescriptions apply to controlled substances; your doctor doesn't prescribe you ibuprofen or some other OTC generic. These substances are controlled because they're dangerous for uninformed users.
4. The only way for this not to be understood as malpractice is to assume that doctors really don't know what you need, so your idea has some merit despite having no rationale or expertise.

I don't have a problem with any of this, it's just not the way I want my personal healthcare to work. It's great if my doctor prioritizes my customer satisfaction; but what I want is unbiased expertise from someone who's after long-term outcomes. Given the way we incentivize them, my suspicion is that US healthcare will trade expertise for immediate customer satisfaction whether or it not ends up being good for the customer. Doing anything else works against their economic interest.

To combat this problem, doctors are highly regulated. Drugs need to be backed by efficacy studies and doctors need to stay informed about the literature. All of this is great but introduces another layer of error: my interests aren't necessarily aligned with measured efficacy for reasons I outline in the next section.

By the way, I really don't think American medicine is evil or nefarious. I got the snip from a qualified urologist. Joyce was really insistent about that one; it's like she didn't think I would totally nail the DIY version first try. Weird. Anyway, my doctor and I had aligned interests for the procedure and it went great. So I really like US healthcare in the same sense that I really like `goto`: when you need it you need it. But I also think it's the wrong tool for long-term, complex problems that impact quality of life. That's not what it was built to solve.

...which is where wiki-fu comes in. I don't think I know more than doctors do, but I'm willing to say that I can wiki my way into being a better doctor for me than I'm likely to discover on the market. I can address my shortcomings in a more targeted way too. Psychiatric care plays a large enough role in my life that I'm willing to make it a core competency.


## Efficacy studies and homeostatic regulation
...or why I supplement tyrosine instead of L-DOPA, tryptophan instead of 5-HTP, etc.

Because I don't do things halfway, I have another beef.

This one is with the way treatment efficacy is reported in literature -- or more specifically, why the most effective treatment can create problems for homeostasis by failing to address the root cause, and people don't discuss the pitfalls when they recommend these strategies.

Let's take [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) as an example, and let's suppose the suspected cause is [low dopaminergic functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Genetics). From a clinical perspective, [NDRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor) are considered highly effective. Rather than increasing dopamine production, they [prevent dopamine reuptake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) -- that is, the same level of dopamine production will result in a higher steady-state level in the brain.

It's easy to see why this works: your brain has very few ways to screw it up, no matter how pathological your dopamine production pipeline is. The flip side is that your brain also has very few ways to downregulate dopamine in the presence of an NDRI, nor is it likely to upregulate the production pipeline given persistently elevated levels even if that's what you need. In other words, NDRIs seem to me like a last-resort kind of solution that makes sense when homeostatic regulation is a lost cause.

I have no doubt that some people need NDRIs, but I don't want to assume that about myself. I'd rather assume that various enzymes are compromised and try supplementing precursors like tyrosine to see if I can fix it on the production side. That way I don't end up with a brain that has decreased receptor sites as its last-resort downregulation mechanism, which I suspect would result in withdrawal issues -- especially if I do something else later that fixes the production pathway.

The approach I describe will have lower measured efficacy than direct treatments like NDRIs _for the general population_, but not for me. That's the difference: absent ethical and time constraints, I can design something that's more robust for me in the long term.
