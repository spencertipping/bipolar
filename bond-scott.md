# Michael Scott and James Bond as the bipolar mood spectrum
Here's what I think are accurate portraits of different moods as you go up the scale.

If you can imagine what it would be like to be these characters, then I think you have a decent understanding of what it would be like to experience each bipolar mood. It's not qualitatively different from what most people go through, it just happens out of context -- that is, not in a situation where it makes sense to feel that way.

I go into a lot more detail about why I picked these videos in [the deep dive](heavy/deepdive.md), but that also gets into some heavy stuff about depression because there isn't a good way to keep it separate. I think you could read that if you're curious, but this page should be enough to get the general picture.
