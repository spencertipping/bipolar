# Michael Scott and James Bond as the bipolar mood spectrum
I don't need to explain anything because TV does it for me. Here's what I think are accurate portraits of different moods as you go up the scale:

+ **Super depressed (0):** [Michael Scott in Scott's Tots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0N2ZxQJYTw)
+ **Super depressed (1):** [Michael Scott at Diwali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTSg6vYJcxs)
+ **Depressed (2):** [The roast of Michael Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS-utbiLy6o)
+ **Depressed (3):** [Jim and Pam's daycare interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMTxLRxiiC8)
+ **Euthymic (4):** [David Wallace in the hot tub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gYbZAAJtIE)
+ **Euthymic (5):** [Jim Halpert plays dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyWE-SmWp4)
+ **Euthymic (6):** [Bond drives a Ford and nothing exciting happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojob6IE4JQ4)
+ **Hypomanic (7):** [Bond wins at poker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfx9bqc3fw)
+ **Hypomanic (8):** [Bond has unbelievable luck (SNL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpibPm7AVE)
+ **Manic (9):** [Bond invents _grand theft bulldozer_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxNbAwY_rk)
+ **Manic (10):** same video but there's no bad guy; Bond does the chase because he feels like a bad guy is probably there

If you can imagine what it would be like to be these characters, then I think you have a decent understanding of what it would be like to experience each bipolar mood. It's not qualitatively different from what most people go through, it's just much more misplaced.
