# Strategy and results
I suspect I have a few major issues that require active intervention:

1. Under-methylation of homocysteine due to MTHFR (and coffee+alcohol probably didn't help)
2. Lithium deficiency
3. General anxiety for a variety of reasons

There are multiple ways to deal with these problems. I chose supplementation because it's cheap, reasonably safe, and easy to do controlled experiments. Then I know what I'm doing for longer-run changes like lifestyle and diet.

**Warning: not medical advice;** I'm writing this up as an example of stuff to look at, not as a "you should do this" list. I mean you probably wouldn't die if you took my list verbatim, but you might complicate things a lot, e.g. with [serotonin syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or by inducing mania from methylfolate or lots of protein. Many of these things also interact with prescription drugs and/or specific genetic conditions, sometimes dangerously. So just a heads-up: what's safe for me might not be safe for you, etc. I recommend doing your own research and not taking the advice of internet strangers, no matter how good-looking we are. It's not our fault, we were just born that way.


## High-level overview
Conceptually, I model the process in layers:

1. Minerals to enable homeostatic regulation (lithium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, etc)
2. (Largely) B-vitamins for neurotransmitter cofactors (plus methylfolate for MTHFR defects)
3. Amino acids for enzyme inputs and NMDA activation
4. Adaptogens to adjust immune response and other mystery things

Now when iterating, I'll make sure (1) is working properly before going to (2), then (3), then (4). Usually if I do anything else, I'll wind up getting depressive due to a deficiency and have to take some downtime to recharge.

Interestingly, almost all of what I'm taking is nutritional, not psychoactive. That is, it's stuff you get from food and environment normally. This makes me suspect that my problems are due to very different RDAs of normal things -- i.e. I get bipolar symptoms from malnutrition (some of which is lithium deficiency) more than due to any intrinsic brain malfunction. Although I have no data or expertise to back this up, I suspect many people are in the same boat and, like me before 2020, don't realize it.


## Current medication routine
I've been on some variant of this since about May/June 2020, so a year as of this writing. The results have been fantastic. I'm alert, focused, consistently motivated, and low-anxiety almost all the time -- none of which I thought I would ever be able to achieve. Also I can exercise, woohoo!!!

I quit caffeine in January 2022. It took about six weeks to get back to normal; apparently using the stuff for 15 years takes a while to unwind. No regrets though, I've got more consistent energy now and less anxiety.

**TODO:** add brands to supplements in case it's relevant, and disclaim that I'm not endorsing anyone, I just tolerate them

**TODO:** at some point, collect commit logs to quantify the change

Everything I use is available over the counter; I don't use prescription medications or have a primary care physician (or even health insurance because I'm a madman). See [diy-medicine](diy-medicine.md) for a totally-not-deranged discussion about why I do these things.


### Since March 2022
Big changes from the last iteration:

1. No more caffeine
2. Casein to deal with immune-related depression and exercise intolerance
3. Dropped standalone tyrosine + tryptophan, now I'm covering most amino acids with casein
4. Cordyceps, which is great stuff

I'll mention that I weigh 186lbs, which might put the dosages here into context a bit.

**Note:** I suspect some of my dosages are above what's necessary. I've gotten great results, but I haven't tuned any of this for efficiency yet and it's a bit of a work in progress. If you know of things I should improve, please let me know.

**Also note:** I really don't understand how riboflavin and methylation are related. It was in an article somewhere and I noticed that I can take less methylfolate when I take riboflavin too, but otherwise I don't get how it works.

**Also also note:** there are different formulas for methylfolate. I use Quatrefolic (6S)-5-MTHF, which seems to work, and I haven't tried any other types.


### Casein vs whey
Is just about half-life. [This article](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/whats-the-difference-between-whey-and-casein-protein.html) sums it up nicely.

I'm not a bodybuilder, so I'm going for slow digestion.

My understanding is that the brain, immune system, and muscles compete for glutamate and/or glutamine, so my goal is to have that covered so I'm never short. I think I was pretty protein-deficient before casein because exercise left me feeling awful; now I look forward to it and am getting a bit stronger+leaner.

Here's a [great paper that goes through bipolar and immune dysfunction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5704151/), by the way. It describes many specific mechanisms of interaction between the two systems.


## Rationale, insofar as one exists
There are a few broad categories of things going on in the meds above.

First, trace metals used to regulate neurotransmitters. Although it isn't currently the medical view, I believe lithium to be an essential mineral, similar to magnesium or potassium (see the lithium section in [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for the whole story). The FDA is reviewing this I believe and may put an RDA on it, which I think would be great. My goal is to make sure that I have enough of all of these even under stress, which I assume will happen more than it would for most people since I probably retain some underlying bipolar cycling. Overdoing lithium or magnesium can cause problems, but I'm well below toxic doses and there are a lot of early warning signs for both. I consider them to be safe to experiment with at the levels I'm taking.

Second, methylation and, more broadly, antioxidants. The Hcy->Met pathway consumes the methyl groups from methylfolate and requires (but doesn't consume) methylated B12. MTHFR mutations mean that I have an impaired folate methylation pathway -- that is, I may have adequate folate but I can't add methyl groups to it very quickly. The methionine cycle then underperforms resulting in high homocysteine, which I feel as uncomfortable anxiety and low energy.

By the way, if you have a 23AndMe SNP file, you can find your MTHFR status by grepping for two specific mutations: `grep rs1801133 snps.txt` for C677T and `grep rs1801131 snps.txt` for A1298C. My values are `AG` for C677T (I have that mutation), and `TT` for A1298C (I don't have that mutation).

Methylation gets a bit more complicated because methionine isn't the only thing homocysteine is used for. It's also a cysteine donor for glutathione via the transsulfuration pathway (the CBS enzyme) -- so if I'm overdriving Hcy->Met, I may be undersupplying cysteine and low on glutathione. I take NAC to correct for this, which I think is the right strategy because I tend to feel more energetic and calmer when I do. I used to take 2.4g daily but got some digestive instability, so bumped it down to 1.2g with no issues.
