# Strategy and results
I suspect I have a few major issues that require active intervention:

1. Under-methylation of homocysteine due to MTHFR (and coffee+alcohol probably didn't help)
2. Lithium deficiency
3. General anxiety for a variety of reasons

There are multiple ways to deal with these problems. I chose supplementation because it's cheap, reasonably safe, and easy to do controlled experiments. Then I know what I'm doing for longer-run changes like lifestyle and diet.

**Warning:** I'm writing this up as an example of stuff to look at, not as a "you should do this" list. I mean you probably wouldn't die if you took my list verbatim, but you might complicate things a lot, e.g. with [serotonin syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or by inducing mania from methylfolate or tyrosine. Many of these things also interact with prescription drugs and/or specific genetic conditions, sometimes dangerously. So just a heads-up: what's safe for me might not be safe for you, etc. I recommend doing your own research and not taking the advice of internet strangers, no matter how good-looking we are. It's not our fault, we were just born that way.


## Current medication routine
I've been on this since about May/June 2020, so a year as of this writing. The results have been fantastic. I'm alert, focused, consistently motivated, and low-anxiety almost all the time -- none of which I thought I would ever be able to achieve.

**TODO:** add brands to supplements in case it's relevant, and disclaim that I'm not endorsing anyone, I just tolerate them

**TODO:** at some point, collect commit logs to quantify the change

Everything I use is available over the counter; I don't use prescription medications or have a primary care physician (or even health insurance because I'm a madman). See [diy-medicine](diy-medicine.md) for a totally-not-deranged discussion about why I do these things.

+ Morning (daily)
  + Neurotransmitter regulation
    + 20mg lithium as lithium aspartate
    + 96mg magnesium via 1333mg magnesium threonate
  + Anxiolytics
    + 500mg theanine (sometimes)
    + 600mg ashwagandha
  + Stimulants and brain circulation
    + 10-15g tyrosine
    + 12-18g yerba mate tea
    + 7g ginkgo biloba + 7g bacopa monnieri + 4g gotu kola + 5g mint + 8g ginger root tea (sometimes, and it's a totally ad-hoc thing, see below)
    + 1g lysine (a component of the AADC enzyme)
  + Methylation
    + 15-30mg methylfolate (as (6S)-5-MTHF, called Quatrefolic)
    + 2.5-5mg methylated B12
    + 400mg riboflavin
    + 2g creatine
  + Antioxidants and glutathione precursors
    + 2400mg long-release NAC
    + 10-20g collagen peptides
    + 1500mg vitamin C
  + Steroid precursors
    + 600IU vitamin D
    + 4-6 eggs + ~100g salmon of cholesterol most mornings
  + Thyroid support
    + The aforementioned tyrosine probably matters here
    + 1000mcg iodine as potassium iodide, spread throughout the morning
+ Evening (daily)
  + 20mg lithium aspartate
  + 4g taurine + 500mg magnesium (as magnesium taurate)
  + 500-1500mg tryptophan peptides (lower = more energy/clarity next day, higher = longer sleep and more relaxed next day)
  + B-vitamin complex
  + Vitamin E
  + 500mg theanine
+ Weekly
  + Selenium (as selenomethionine, which incidentally requires B6 to absorb)

**Note:** I suspect some of my dosages are above what's necessary. I've gotten great results, but I haven't tuned any of this for efficiency yet and it's a bit of a work in progress. If you know of things I should improve, please let me know.

**Also note:** I really don't understand how riboflavin and methylation are related. It was in an article somewhere and I noticed that I can take less methylfolate when I take riboflavin too, but otherwise I don't get how it works.

**Also also note:** there are different formulas for methylfolate. I use Quatrefolic (6S)-5-MTHF, which seems to work, and I haven't tried any other types.

I also usually eat eggs and fish for breakfast, usually four eggs and 4-6oz of tuna or salmon. Dietary choline isn't a problem, although eggs and fish keep me awake if I eat them at night and I can't supplement alpha-GPC, citicholine, or alpha-lipoic acid without getting really depressed.

I still have minor mood and energy cycling throughout the year, but nothing like before. Sometimes I'll try to course-correct; here are some of the options I'll use (usually a subset, not all of them):

+ If I've been sick or feel really bad (uncommon):
  + 10g glutamine (possible excitotoxicity risk if used long-term)
  + 5-10-20mg DHEA (possible steroid-related risks if used long-term)
+ If I'm depressed or sluggish (uncommon, maybe 1-3 days/quarter)
  + more ginkgo+bacopa tea
  + +5-10mg methylfolate + 2.5mg methyl-B12
  + +48mg magnesium threonate
  + +5g tyrosine
  + +15g unsweetened baker's cocoa, as tea (for theobromine)
+ If I'm anxious or jittery (more common, maybe 7-10 days/quarter)
  + Decrease tyrosine and collagen
  + +500-1000mg theanine as needed throughout the day
  + +600mg ashwagandha
  + +3-5g taurine (without magnesium)
  + +500mg tryptophan peptides
  + +5-10mg methylfolate + 2.5mg methyl-B12

Methylfolate shows up on both lists, which may be counterintuitive. In my experience, methylation problems can cause both depression and anxiety depending on other factors. I rarely have any problems if I overdo methylation a bit, so I usually start by making sure that base is covered before doing much else. (And I consider that to be a good sign because it means I'm not way-overdoing methylation on an everyday basis.)


## Rationale, insofar as one exists
There are a few broad categories of things going on in the meds above.

First, trace metals used to regulate neurotransmitters. Although it isn't the medical view, I believe lithium to be an essential mineral, similar to magnesium or potassium (see the lithium section in [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for the whole story). My goal is to make sure that I have enough of all of these even under stress, which I assume will happen more than it would for most people since I probably retain some underlying bipolar cycling. Overdoing lithium or magnesium can cause problems, but I'm well below toxic doses and there are a lot of early warning signs for both. I consider them to be safe to experiment with at the levels I'm taking.

Second, methylation and, more broadly, antioxidants. The Hcy->Met pathway consumes the methyl groups from methylfolate and requires (but doesn't consume) methylated B12. MTHFR mutations mean that I have an impaired folate methylation pathway -- that is, I may have adequate folate but I can't add methyl groups to it very quickly. The methionine cycle then underperforms resulting in high homocysteine, which I feel as uncomfortable anxiety.

Methylation gets a bit more complicated because methionine isn't the only thing homocysteine is used for. It's also a cysteine donor for glutathione via the transsulfuration pathway -- so if I'm overdriving Hcy->Met, I may be undersupplying cysteine and low on glutathione. I take NAC to correct for this, which I think is the right strategy because I tend to feel more energetic and calmer when I do.


## How this regimen came about
The first thing was theanine, which led to a false sense of security about mental stability.


### The woo-woo gingko herbal tea stuff
Hardly the most important thing on the list, but I should mention where this comes from and what it's about.

There are various studies that suggest ginkgo and bacopa are good for brain circulation, help memory, and are neuroprotective. I started at the recommended dose and then multiplied it by 10 because I like to live dangerously (let's be honest: when "ginkgo biloba overdose" turns up nothing scary, that's just because people haven't tried hard enough).

Gotu kola I have no idea about. It's a traditional herb and I'm a whore for ancient nootropics, so that's about all there is to it.

The ratios aren't special. I filled a mason jar equally by volume with ginkgo, bacopa, gotu kola, and mint leaves, then put some ginger on top. Joyce took that mixture and calculated precise gram amounts so she could make it in bulk, since she drinks it too.

**Warning about hepatotoxicity:** a lot of herbal things are toxic to the liver when consumed in large amounts over long periods of time. Gotu kola may be one of them ([example study cited by the wikipedia article](http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1130-01082005000200006&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en)). I don't worry a lot about this because most of the studies I've seen indicate that the effects are temporary and I take NAC, which generally tends to reduce liver toxicity (this is not medically sound reasoning, btw). That said, I try to be broadly aware of things like this before randomly experimenting with stuff.
