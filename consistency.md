# Consistency vs genius
Methamphetamine is illegal; bipolar is not. We bipolar people have a rare gift in that we have access to mental states that most people don't, and given enough time behind the wheel we can find ways to use them to do things most people can't. Like meth, bipolar will destroy your brain and your life if you aren't careful -- but let's stick with the upsides for a moment.

All of my best work was done when hypomanic. I came up with projects that existed right on the edge of what was possible and executed them in superhuman two-week-long sprints. Most of those projects happened to be insane or worthless, but I came away from each one different: more capable, more resourceful, more appreciative of the intricacies in the problem space.

When Joyce insisted that I would be more productive by prioritizing consistency, I disagreed completely. Everyone is consistent; I was different because I was intermittently brilliant. She was also right, though: my inconsistent execution and short sprints made it impossible to achieve much of substance. I could learn something new but that was about it; I'd never build anything real.
