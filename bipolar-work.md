# Bipolar at work
This one is complicated for me to summarize because even without bipolar I'm just a strange person. I'm not sure how to attribute my career progression to mental illness vs mental weirdness, but some parts are obvious so I'll start with those.

In case my github profile didn't give it away, I'm a programmer. I've tended to work at startups doing off-beat, largely solo problems that didn't fit neatly into other departments. In a vacuum, my bias is digging below the commonly-accepted level of abstraction to question what gets taken for granted and find alternative strategies to solve problems. This results in unorthodox solutions that are sometimes crucial and are almost always difficult for others to maintain.

That bias isn't a bad one in my opinion. It's been tremendously useful, particularly in my not-at-work life where I do DIY projects and learn about different types of engineering. And I think it's a large part of why I'm valuable to companies I work for.

But it's also at the core of the conflicts I observe between myself and employers when I'm too impaired to mediate it into something constructive. Instead of being open-minded and creative, I come across as un-empathetic and overly critical. Other people's shortcomings aren't opportunities for me to be a helpful or supportive person, they're obstacles to productivity that I don't have the energy or patience to deal with.


## All's fair in love and work
I'm critical of corporate culture on this page, so I wanted to contextualize it by stating my biases.

Perhaps controversially, I don't believe companies have any moral obligation towards their employees. I'm a big fan of at-will employment: anyone can walk for any reason, so every conflict is a matter of retention. That includes mental illness: I've never liked the idea that companies would view me as needing special protections. Maybe I'm weird, but my brain is my problem and not theirs. I can either justify my weirdness on the basis of providing value or I can't.

So when I indict some corporate norm for being irrational, there's no moral superiority behind it. Companies have the right to make decisions that I think are self-destructive or pointless. I don't want any moral or legal leverage to make them change.


### Philosophical aside: why this worldview is awful
My worldview reeks of privilege because I'm selfish and lack perspective. I'm happy to appeal to individualistic consent-absolutism (which I genuinely value) to avoid hard moral questions about human dignity. Philosophically, this is as bankrupt as using freedom of speech to justify fraud.

A more visceral indictment is that my self-image is predicated on being intelligent and capable. I don't have a way to understand myself absent those attributes. Correspondingly, like most narcissists, I lack some basic empathy for people who are less self-sufficient. I'll say "let's create a UBI" as though the problem is isolated to economic policy, ignoring the larger issue that we confuse productivity for dignity.

All of this is morally consistent with my dissociated state the day after I attempted suicide. I think some analog of that conflict is intrinsically relatable to most people. I don't have an answer to it yet.

Anyway, amateur philosophy aside, let's get into the substance of why mental illness and work don't always mix.


## Corporate nice
I like people who call corporate culture on its bullshit. One such freedom fighter is Steve Yegge, whose [cynical deconstruction of Google Cloud's deprecation policy and surrounding PR](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc) perfectly exemplifies a mood-disordered read on the broader space of office lingo. (Steve Yegge doesn't have a mental illness to my knowledge, I just like the way he reads between the lines.)

The problem is simple: corporations are made of people, yet certain degrees of humanity don't fit well into a corporate environment. So we put suits on monkeys and feign ubiquitous warmth by littering communications with non-sequitur "please" and "thank you". I have to think that neurotypical people tolerate this rather than embracing it, but either way it creates a challenging environment for anyone with compromised affect.

Take a simple email:

> Michael,
>
> In the future, please use sharepoint to report expenses.
>
> Thank you,
> Steve

Eminently professional, but emotionally opaque. It comes across well to a euthymic reader, who can reasonably assume that Steve is just suggesting a workflow improvement. A depressed reader will interpret it less charitably. Without neurochemical self-assurance, we see Steve passive-aggressively saying he's done with our shit and we need to get it together before he ends our career.

The problem with corporate nice is that both interpretations are believable. Corporate nice flattens the sender's affect into an indecipherable uniform tone, placing the burden of interpretation onto the reader. In particular, the reader's interpretation will be strongly colored by their prior expectations of how the sender feels about them: and that varies substantially by affective state.

**TODO:** explore alternatives, if I can think of any


## Responding in kind
Receiving corporate-nice emails isn't the real problem with America. The real problem is when you have to write to someone else. This is where corporate nice turns into a gauntlet: we all understand what it sounds like, but like any human language it isn't codified anywhere. If your affect is AWOL, it's very difficult to understand what sounds sane and what doesn't. In fact, it's hard to anticipate what will even sound like _you_ when you're back to a normal mood.

Trying, failing, and worrying about projecting corporate nice is the biggest single issue I've faced as a result of having bipolar at work -- although it isn't the biggest reason I've been unproductive. That's described below. It's just been the largest point of stress, and I have no doubt that I've sent some emails or slack messages that have sounded at least a little deranged. My coworkers have been very kind on the occasions when it was noticeable.

I've often wanted a way to asynchronously communicate some type of "out of order" status: not that I can't get work done, but that if you talk to me I will sound bizarre in some way. Having a status page like this, and being able to socialize it easily, would have made my work experience much easier. It probably would have demanded more self-awareness than I had on a number of occasions, but my life also would have been less stressful.


## Limiting liability
Here's another related issue I ran into: let's suppose I wanted to break out of corporate nice for a moment and say "hey look, I'm seriously depressed today so I'm not going to sound normal." This creates a new problem: how many implicit expectations am I transferring to my employer?

Ideally none, but I don't want it to be ambiguous. So I'll feel a little compelled to say something like "don't worry, you don't have to do anything" -- but isn't that presumptive? If I'm depressed it definitely sounds that way.

After this kind of overthinking I'd often end up not sending anything at all. I'd quietly go to work and hope that nobody wanted to talk to me.

This problem was entirely my fault. Had I been thinking about it more clearly, I would have written up [email templates](emails.md) to deal with common situations.
