# Bipolar at work
This one is complicated for me to summarize because even without bipolar I'm just a strange person. I'm not sure how to attribute my career progression to mental illness vs mental weirdness, but some parts are obvious so I'll start with those.

In case my github profile didn't give it away, I'm a programmer. I've tended to work at startups doing off-beat, largely solo problems that didn't fit neatly into other departments. In a vacuum, my bias is digging below the commonly-accepted level of abstraction to question what gets taken for granted and find alternative strategies to solve problems. This results in unorthodox solutions that are sometimes crucial and are almost always difficult for others to maintain.

That bias isn't a bad one in my opinion. It's been tremendously useful, particularly in my not-at-work life where I do DIY projects and learn about different types of engineering. And I think it's a large part of why I'm valuable to companies I work for.

But it's also at the core of the conflicts I observe between myself and employers when I'm too impaired to mediate it into something constructive. Instead of being open-minded and creative, I come across as un-empathetic and overly critical. Other people's shortcomings aren't opportunities for me to be a helpful or supportive person, they're obstacles to productivity that I don't have the energy or patience to deal with.


## "Corporate nice": not just for Minnesotans
I like people who call corporate culture on its bullshit. One such freedom fighter is Steve Yegge, whose [cynical deconstruction of Google Cloud's deprecation policy and surrounding PR](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc) perfectly exemplifies a mood-disordered read on the broader space of office lingo.

The problem is simple: corporations are made of people, yet certain degrees of humanity don't fit well into a corporate environment. As a result we have superficially dressed-up missives into which we can still read the full range of human emotion -- and if you're coming from a whacked-out affective extreme, this interpretive voice goes on full blast.

It's an inconvenience when "in future, please use sharepoint to report expenses" is a character assassination rather than a suggestion for improved workflow. Depression can be a real downer, leaving one to wish the sender had included an aside about us being a lovely person really, just with an adorably misguided sense of the admittedly complex expense reporting procedure. It happens to the best of us.

Aside: [depressed-me isn't alone: ways to overthink "okay"](https://www.insidehook.com/article/advice/the-difference-between-texting-k-ok-kk-explained).

But that's not the real problem plaguing corporate America. The real problem is when you have to write to someone else. This is where "corporate nice" turns into a gauntlet that can very easily fail: we all understand what "corporate nice" sounds like, but like any human language it isn't codified anywhere. If your affect is AWOL, it's very difficult to understand what sounds sane and what doesn't. In fact, it's hard to anticipate what will even sound like _you_ when you're back to a normal mood.

Trying, failing, and worrying about projecting corporate nice is the biggest single issue I've faced as a result of having bipolar at work -- although it isn't the biggest reason I've been unproductive. That's in the next section. It's just been the largest point of stress, and I have no doubt that I've sent some emails or slack messages that have sounded at least a little deranged. This is likely after many revisions.

I've often wanted a way to asynchronously communicate some type of "out of order" status: not that I can't get work done, but that if you talk to me I will sound bizarre in some way. Having a status page like this, and being able to socialize it easily, would have made my work experience much easier. It probably would have demanded more self-awareness than I had on a number of occasions, but my life also would have been less stressful.
