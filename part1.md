## Part 1: defining the requirements
In practice this was a lot more incremental and scattered than I'm describing here, but that's just because I didn't know what I was doing nor what was possible. Here's the cleaned-up view in hindsight.


### The problem: mental symptoms I wanted to fix
1. I would routinely start a project, have tons of energy for a couple of weeks, then crash hard and lose interest in almost everything. As time went on, I'd get these bursts less frequently and became less productive.
2. I was increasingly anxious about nothing in particular. It got to the point where I often wanted to leave my life behind and start over, I guess to get rid of something I assumed was causing my stress.
3. I was suicidal most days and often medicated with alcohol, which didn't really address the problem and likely made it worse over time. It was very difficult to hold down a full-time job in this state.
4. I was generally neither productive nor smart. I hadn't written anything worthwhile in a couple of years, nor did I have any plans to. I hadn't given up, but didn't see a way forward.
5. Many times in the spring (usually mid to late April) I would become dissociated and want to leave my job, life, etc. In 2020 my plan was to become homeless and live under a bridge; that sounded awesome because nobody would expect anything from me. In prior years I had left jobs or incompetently attempted suicide.


### Constraints for a treatment strategy
I'll describe this from two perspectives because I think it's important to understand how it looks.

**Before pursuing treatment:** medical intervention just looked bad. The emphasis tended to be on stability, which I assumed would focus on preventing mania (true), so I expected to lose the highs I used to get things done and be largely unproductive/unmotivated. This was consistent with accounts I had seen online. Further, people complained about side effects ranging from weight gain to kidney failure. My mom had been misprescribed SSRIs for depression, probably caused by borderline or bipolar disorder, and both mentally and physically degraded over the span of about ten years before committing suicide in 2011.

**After pursuing treatment:** my space of concerns isn't different, and I'm glad I'm not taking anyone else's word for these things. I have a lot of control over how I function, which is really all I wanted. Rather than trying to mitigate positive symptoms, I focus on thinking better: without any intervention my brain wasn't getting what it needed; I frequently ran low on dopamine, my metabolism was underperforming due to MTHFR, and my depressive crashes and anxiety were a symptom of oxidative stress. Bipolar wasn't a thing to be fixed, it was a sign that my body and mind weren't working correctly. I take medications (really supplements) to think better, feel better, and be more capable.

With that in mind, I wanted a treatment plan that met my needs, which were:

1. No adverse physiological side effects (including boring ones like weight gain)
2. No long-term neurodegeneration
3. No loss of mental function, especially for cognitively challenging R+D work
4. No controlled substances: robust supply chains for everything, whether or not I have health insurance or a primary care practitioner (I currently have neither)
5. Graceful fallbacks in case I need to change things down the line


### Quick meta-commentary about treatment methodology
I strongly believe that people considering different treatment strategies should (1) understand the process as a form of enhancement rather than mitigation, (2) prioritize quality of life above almost all else, and (3) have some fallback treatment strategies in mind -- bipolar has an abysmal medical compliance rate (numbers vary, but are commonly reported between 30% and 70% after two years -- for instance [this 2000 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12340472_Clinical_Factors_Associated_With_Treatment_Noncompliance_in_Euthymic_Bipolar_Patients)).

More controversially, I also believe people need better recreational alternatives to dangerous drugs like alcohol and, in certain cases, caffeine. I don't have numbers to quantify this, but I commonly see bipolar associated with substance abuse as a form of self-medication. Alcohol in particular is profoundly dangerous in conjunction with mental illness because it can impair methylation and deplete lithium, magnesium, and B-vitamins -- all of which are required to maintain normal brain function.
