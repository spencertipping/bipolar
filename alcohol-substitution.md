# GABA-ergic drugs and alcohol substitution
[GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor_positive_allosteric_modulator) such as alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium), and nonbenzodiazepines (Ambien) reduce anxiety by increasing [GABA-A receptor activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor), which increases the amount of voltage required to activate neurons, resulting in less neurotransmission (and, I assume, less excitotoxicity, which I imagine is why people claim that small amounts of alcohol can be neuroprotective). Withdrawal is a big issue because excitotoxicity is miserable and can kill you.

In my opinion, the goal isn't to forcibly suppress excitotoxicity by amplifying GABA receptors; it's probably better ensure adequate supply of natural NMDA inhibitors like GABA and magnesium. The brain has regulatory mechanisms designed to prevent excitotoxicity, many of which rely on things like B vitamins and trace minerals to function properly.


## Much safer neurotransmission inhibitors
Here's a list of GABA-ergic substances that, in my opinion, are far safer than alcohol, feel better, and may even be neuroprotective:

+ [Theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine)
+ [N-acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) ([effects on glutamate neurotransmission in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985009/))
+ [Lithium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2868724/)
+ [Magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_in_biology) ([effects on glutamate in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18799816/))
+ [B vitamins](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311242581_Relation_between_vitamins_of_the_b_complex_GABA_and_glutamate_and_their_role_in_neurocognitive_disorders_-Brief_review)

When I say "much safer", I'm referring both to addictive potential and effects from typical long-term use. Although lithium can cause organ damage when taken in large amounts (e.g. 1000mg/day for years), nobody would do this recreationally and it isn't addictive. There's some evidence that suggests deficiency is a much more dangerous condition than overdose.

Theanine, from what I can tell, is nonaddictive, neuroprotective, and incredibly safe. In my opinion it should be most people's front-line recreational relaxant (certainly preferred over alcohol). Some pubmed articles about it:

+ [Safety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26192072/)
+ [Neuroprotection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31145971/)
+ [Prevention of alcohol-induced liver damage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16141543/)
+ [Rats do fine when given absurdly high amounts of theanine for weeks on end](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691506000949)


## Specific amounts I've used as an alcohol substitute
I wasn't about doing any legwork when I was drinking regularly, so I started to make an "instead of drinking, do this" list I could quickly go through to feel better. Here's the most recent revision:

+ 1000mg theanine
+ 1200mg N-acetylcysteine
+ 600mg ashwagandha
+ 5mg lithium aspartate
+ 3000mg magnesium taurate
+ 1000mg tryptophan peptides (or 2000mg non-peptides) -- note that there is some [kynurenine risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenine) associated with B6 deficiency and psychiatric disorders
+ 1-2mg methylfolate -- specifically to address homocysteine caused by alcohol withdrawal
+ B-vitamin complex every day just to cover the bases (deficiencies can cause anxiety and other problems)

I'll note that I didn't expect this to be healthy, strictly speaking -- recreational drugs don't tend to be, and I wasn't trying to outrun the bear. I just needed something better than drinking.

This substitution treated me very well: I didn't get any hangover or withdrawal, no loss in coordination or mental function, I was more reliably relaxed than I was with alcohol, and I suspect it's neuroprotective. I no longer have any interest in using alcohol medicinally; i.e. I don't miss it at all.
