# GABA-ergic drugs and alcohol substitution
**TODO:** re-outline and rewrite this page; it lacks continuity

**Quick note:** despite having been an alcoholic in the past, I'm not anti-alcohol and still drink occasionally. This section reads like I'm a conflicted Baptist because I think our cultural sensibilities around alcohol are really bad. Engineers don't learn computer science on PHP and `goto`, and humans shouldn't learn psychoactives on alcohol and weed. That's the big thing I'm pushing back against on this page: not that people use alcohol, but that people _misuse_ it.

[GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor_positive_allosteric_modulator) such as alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium), and nonbenzodiazepines (Ambien) reduce anxiety by increasing [GABA-A receptor activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor), which increases the amount of voltage required to activate neurons, resulting in less neurotransmission (and, I assume, less excitotoxicity, which I imagine is why people claim that small amounts of alcohol can be neuroprotective). Withdrawal is a big issue because excitotoxicity is miserable and can kill you.

In my opinion, the goal isn't to forcibly suppress excitotoxicity by amplifying GABA receptors; it's probably better ensure adequate supply of natural NMDA inhibitors like GABA and magnesium. The brain has regulatory mechanisms designed to prevent excitotoxicity, many of which rely on things like B vitamins and trace minerals to function properly. (I have a whole section about why I try not to bypass homeostatic regulation in [sources](sources.md).)

Alcohol is also problematic from a pharmacokinetic perspective due to its zero-order elimination rate and toxic metabolites. See the "pharmacokinetics" section of [supplements](supplements.md) for more about this.


## Common deficiencies in alcoholics
+ [Vitamins A, B1, B6, and B9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3544907/) -- of these, B6 and B9 are critical for neurotransmitter metabolism
+ [Vitamins B6, B9, and B12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10758367/) -- B6 is critical for neurotransmitter function, and B9 and B12 collectively detoxify homocysteine into methionine (see the methylation section of [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for more context)
+ [Magnesium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7836619/), which interacts with NMDA/GABA and is a CNS relaxant

Basically, alcohol is addictive not only because it manipulates GABA receptors, but also because it depletes the body's natural GABA production mechanisms. Both of these things can be addressed more constructively with other substances, all of which are cheap, safer than alcohol, and available OTC.


## Much safer neurotransmission inhibitors
Here's a list of GABA-ergic substances that, in my opinion, are far safer than alcohol, feel better, and are widely considered to be neuroprotective:

+ [Theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine)
+ [N-acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) ([effects on glutamate neurotransmission in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985009/), the "I can't believe it's not people" of research rodents)
+ [Lithium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2868724/)
+ [Magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_in_biology) ([effects on glutamate in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18799816/), the "other other _homo sapiens_")
+ [B vitamins](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311242581_Relation_between_vitamins_of_the_b_complex_GABA_and_glutamate_and_their_role_in_neurocognitive_disorders_-Brief_review)

When I say "much safer", I'm referring both to addictive potential and effects from typical long-term use. Although lithium can cause organ damage when taken in large amounts (e.g. 1000mg/day for decades), nobody would use this much recreationally and it isn't addictive. 5mg/day would be a perfectly reasonable amount to take, and comparable to what you'd get environmentally from groundwater in some places. There's some evidence that deficiency is a more dangerous and much more common condition than overdose (see the "lithium" section of [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for a list of studies and additional context/safety info).

Theanine is considered to be nonaddictive, neuroprotective, and incredibly safe. It has no withdrawal and no side-effects. In my opinion it should be most people's front-line recreational relaxant (certainly preferred over alcohol). Some pubmed articles about it:

+ [Safety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26192072/)
+ [Neuroprotection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31145971/)
+ [Prevention of alcohol-induced liver damage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16141543/)
+ [Rats do fine when given absurdly high amounts of theanine for weeks on end by presumably deranged researchers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691506000949)

Theanine and NAC have both been shown to mitigate alcohol-related liver damage when taken before consuming alcohol. NAC in particular is commonly used to detoxify the liver during acetaminophen overdose. I recall seeing studies tying both to decreased neurodegeneration from alcohol use (**TODO:** find said studies or remove this sentence).

NAC is also demonstrated to help with alcohol-withdrawal depression in mice (which are essentially _homo sapiens_ in every conceivable way; [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704590/)).


## Specific amounts I've used as an alcohol substitute
I wasn't about doing any legwork when I was drinking regularly, so I started to make an "instead of drinking, do this" list I could quickly go through to feel better. Here's the most recent revision:

+ 1000mg theanine
+ 1200mg N-acetylcysteine
+ 600mg ashwagandha
+ 5mg lithium aspartate
+ 3000mg magnesium taurate
+ 1000mg tryptophan peptides (or 2000mg non-peptides) -- note that there is some [kynurenine risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenine) associated with B6 deficiency and psychiatric disorders
+ 1-2mg methylfolate -- specifically to address homocysteine caused by alcohol withdrawal
+ B-vitamin complex every day just to cover the bases (deficiencies can cause anxiety and other problems; see the B-vitamin section in [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for details)

I'll note that I didn't expect this to be healthy, strictly speaking -- recreational drugs don't tend to be, and I wasn't trying to outrun the bear. I just needed something better than drinking.

This substitution treated me very well: I didn't get any hangover or withdrawal, no loss in coordination or mental function, I was more reliably relaxed than I was with alcohol, and I suspect it's neuroprotective. I no longer have any interest in using alcohol medicinally; i.e. I don't miss it at all.
