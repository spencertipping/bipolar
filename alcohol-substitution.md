# GABA-ergic drugs and alcohol substitution
**Quick note:** despite having been an alcoholic in the past, I'm not anti-alcohol and still drink occasionally. This section reads like I'm a conflicted Baptist because I think our cultural sensibilities around alcohol are really bad. Engineers don't learn computer science on PHP and `goto`, and humans shouldn't learn psychoactives on alcohol and weed. That's the big thing I'm pushing back against on this page: not that people use alcohol, but that people _misuse_ and, more importantly, misunderstand it.

I'll start by explaining how alcohol works and why it presents long-term health risks, then end with some sections on how you can get similar effects with safer alternatives.


## How alcohol works: GABA and NMDA receptors
The core issue at play is NMDA receptors, which are like a throttle control for brain activity. More NMDA means more neuronal firing, which means the brain burns more calories and requires more oxygen. Too much NMDA for too long and you get excitotoxicity, which can cause long-term brain damage.

See [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for a list of Wikipedia articles that explain the process in detail.

Alcohol, benzos, and similar drugs will artificially raise GABA receptor activity -- they're [GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor_positive_allosteric_modulator) -- which causes the brain to slow down. This tends to reduce anxiety and can also reduce oxidative stress, but only in the short term.

Over time, of course, the body will correct for anything that modifies receptor bindings. This is true of alcohol, benzos, heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, SSRIs, NDRIs, ... basically every potent drug that leaves the body with no other way to re-regulate a substance. I talk more about the issues with drugs like this in the "efficacy studies and homeostatic regulation" section of [diy-medicine](diy-medicine.md).

Modifying receptors like this is a slow process, which means if you stop taking something like alcohol, benzos, or heroin you're going to be pretty miserable for a while. There's a good reason for this: withdrawal creates imbalances that are quite bad for you. This is why withdrawal tends to be tapered: if you try to quit cold turkey you can cause serious brain damage.

All of this to say, alcohol is not a safe drug by any sane definition. It has its uses and I'm not a purist about it, but I think it's important to understand how it works and what you might substitute for it if you want something with similar effects.


## Zero-order pharmacokinetics = quadratic exposure
I have a section of pharmacokinetics in [supplements](supplements.md), but the gist is that alcohol is unlike most other drugs in that the liver eliminates it at a constant rate. That means there is no half-life for alcohol: if you consume twice as many drinks, you'll be drunk for twice as long -- and more importantly, your body will be under four times the total influence from alcohol (defined as amount x time, or the area under the curve).

This has some important implications, one of which being that two drinks at the same time exposes you to twice as much total intoxication as two drinks consumed an hour apart even though it's the same amount of alcohol. In general, `total exposure = (maximum intoxication)Â²`.


## Common deficiencies in alcoholics
Alcohol breaks down to acetaldehyde, which is difficult for the body to work with and depletes some important nutrients, many of which are cofactors for neurotransmitters. See [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for a more detailed discussion.

Here are some of the things alcohol tends to deplete (with duplicates because each refers to a study):

+ [Vitamins A, B1, B6, and B9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3544907/) -- of these, B6 and B9 are critical for neurotransmitter metabolism
+ [Vitamins B6, B9, and B12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10758367/) -- B6 is critical for neurotransmitter function, and B9 and B12 collectively detoxify homocysteine into methionine (see the methylation section of [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for more context)
+ [Magnesium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7836619/), which interacts with NMDA/GABA and is a CNS relaxant

Basically, alcohol is addictive not only because it manipulates GABA receptors, but also because it depletes the body's natural GABA production mechanisms.


## Safer DIY GABA upregulation
If the goal is to feel relaxed and unwind, there are safer and more effective strategies that don't result in hangover or cognitive impairment. Here's a short list of substances that help the body manufacture GABA on its own, and correspondingly aren't addictive:

+ [Theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine)
+ [N-acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) ([effects on glutamate neurotransmission in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985009/), the "I can't believe it's not people" of research rodents)
+ [Lithium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2868724/)
+ [Magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_in_biology) ([effects on glutamate in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18799816/), the "other other _homo sapiens_")
+ [B vitamins](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311242581_Relation_between_vitamins_of_the_b_complex_GABA_and_glutamate_and_their_role_in_neurocognitive_disorders_-Brief_review)

Lithium is controversial, in my opinion much more than it should be. I have a section on this in [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md).

Theanine is, by all research, incredibly safe. It has no withdrawal and no side-effects. In my opinion it should be most people's front-line recreational relaxant because it's nearly impossible to misuse. Some pubmed articles about it:

+ [Safety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26192072/)
+ [Neuroprotection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31145971/)
+ [Prevention of alcohol-induced liver damage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16141543/)
+ [Rats do fine when given absurdly high amounts of theanine for weeks on end by presumably deranged researchers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691506000949)

Interestingly, theanine and NAC have both been shown to mitigate alcohol-related liver damage when taken before consuming alcohol. NAC in particular is commonly used to detoxify the liver during acetaminophen overdose.

NAC is also demonstrated to help with alcohol-withdrawal depression in mice ([pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704590/)), which, as any scientist will tell you, means it does exactly the same thing in politicians and humans who like cheese. OK, sorry for all the mouse comments; I just find it funny how much we study mice to learn about ourselves. There's a great Monty Python skit that comes to mind, but that I can't find on youtube; all I can find is an [audio version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZx9YBhZrZA).


## Specific amounts I've used as an alcohol substitute
I wasn't about doing any legwork when I was drinking regularly, so I started to make an "instead of drinking, do this" list I could quickly go through to feel better. Here's the most recent revision:

+ 1000mg theanine
+ 1200mg N-acetylcysteine
+ 600mg ashwagandha
+ 5mg lithium aspartate
+ 3000mg magnesium taurate
+ 1000mg tryptophan peptides (or 2000mg non-peptides) -- note that there is some [kynurenine risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenine) associated with B6 deficiency and psychiatric disorders
+ 1-2mg methylfolate -- specifically to address homocysteine caused by alcohol withdrawal
+ B-vitamin complex every day just to cover the bases (deficiencies can cause anxiety and other problems; see the B-vitamin section in [neurotransmitters](neurotransmitters.md) for details)

I'll note that I didn't expect this to be healthy, strictly speaking -- recreational drugs don't tend to be, and I wasn't trying to outrun the bear. I just needed something better than drinking.

I end up taking most of this every day now. See [strategy](strategy.md) for the full picture. I have zero complaints with how I feel on this, and I have no side effects like hangovers, brain fog, or weight gain.


## If you're an alcoholic, there are better options
If there's anything to be taken away from all this, it's that there are better alternatives to a life of hangovers and brain damage. In terms of recreational drugs, it's hard to find anything legal that's worse for you than chronic alcohol use. I mean I'm sure you can, but no OTC supplements will get you there unless you seriously misuse them.

I rarely consume alcohol anymore. I probably drink a beer per quarter, and don't drink the whole thing in one day. It's great: I'm never hung over, my mind is clear and sharp 24/7, and I'm pretty much always relaxed and anxiety-free.

The most surprising thing is that I don't ever want to get drunk again -- that is, I don't miss it. I used to hit the whiskey in the evenings, maybe five or ten drinks' worth to unwind. Now the thought of being drunk seems like a real downer: I'd be unable to think properly and would wake up hung over in the middle of the night. The new normal is better than the best I'd get when drinking, and that's something I never thought I'd be able to say.
