## Part 0: background reading on neurotransmitters and metabolism
Here's a list of Wikipedia and pubmed articles I found to be most helpful when designing a treatment strategy for my bipolar symptoms. Again, not authoritative or complete, just some starting points I used to figure things out.


## The five-minute version
If you don't have time to read everything, here's (in my opinion) the most important stuff to know about:

+ [MTHFR enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase), the methionine cycle, and hyperhomocysteinemia -- common failure points if you have an MTHFR mutation (can be addressed with methylfolate, but read more before doing this long-term)
+ [Lithium aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aspartate), an OTC form of lithium that, IMO, is safe and everyone should take at 5mg/day or more (I take 40mg/day)
+ [Glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione): "the master antioxidant" (made from glutamate + glycine + cysteine), limited by cysteine availability
+ [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine): the amino acid precursor to dopamine, melanin, and thyroid hormone -- I take 10g/day, which is a lot
+ [This page about alcohol, GABA, and NMDA](alcohol-substitution.md), which covers what I think should be common cultural knowledge regarding GABA-ergic drugs like alcohol


## Lithium: trace metal for neurotransmitter regulation
I have an ax to grind here: I really think lithium is an essential trace mineral, and I think people take humongous amounts for psychiatric disorders and suffer through major side effects when smaller amounts would get a lot of the benefit. I'm not alone in suspecting these things; a number of studies have come out in support of this view.

Lithium has a far worse reputation than I think it deserves, especially in small quantities. I take 40mg/day to think more clearly and have no side effects. I suspect most people would benefit from 5mg/day, which is on the high side of what you might encounter in groundwater.

It's often prescribed in much higher doses for bipolar and other disorders; prescriptions range anywhere from 900mg-1800mg/day of lithium carbonate (~150mg-300mg of elemental lithium, if I remember right). This is why it causes problems for people. I haven't found any documented risks related to microdosing, and several articles have suggested it's neuroprotective.

+ [Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))
  + [Texas study suggesting that lithium is a trace nutrient](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1699579/)
  + [Japanese study associating trace lithium with lower suicide risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19407280/)
  + [Lithium aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aspartate), an OTC and, in my opinion, safe supplement I've used since September 2019 with no issues

**Note about initial side effects:** I got very absent-minded for a couple of weeks when I started on even a small amount of lithium (2mg/day). I also felt nauseous for about 30min after each dose.

These side effects both went away. The absent-mindedness turned out to be the feature, not a bug: I had grown accustomed to keeping track of thoughts by obsession, not by habit. Lithium prevented ideas from lingering if I wasn't thinking about them. I had to get used to this and learned to actively remember things. Now it's awesome and I would never go back: I'm much more deliberate and focused, and I never have nagging or obsessive thoughts.


## Methylation: general metabolism and oxidative stress
+ [Methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation), relevant for reducing oxidative stress if you have an MTHFR mutation (I have C677T; 23AndMe can tell you what you are)
  + [MTHFR enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase)
  + [Homocysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine), most importantly the [methionine cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine#/media/File:MTHFR_metabolism.svg)
  + [Hyperhomocysteinemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhomocysteinemia), the reason I was anxious and miserable -- ([pubmed on Hcy and alcohol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10905999/), [pubmed on Hcy and coffee/caffeine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12450889/))

**Note:** homocysteine is used for multiple things in the body, including glutathione synthesis (via the trans-sulfuration pathway as an indirect cysteine source, see [this pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12631446/) for example). I supplement [NAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) as a substitute to supply cysteine in case my methylation adjustments result in too much Hcy->Met conversion.


## NMDA receptors: up- and down-regulating neurotransmission
+ [NMDA receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor)
  + [Excitotoxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity), particularly due to [glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter))
    + [Theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine): a safe and neuroprotective glutamate antagonist found in matcha tea that I think everyone should be familiar with (I discuss it in the context of alcohol use [here](alcohol-substitution.md))
  + [GABA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid), the NMDA inhibitor (relaxant) people upregulate with alcohol and benzodiazepines
  + [GABA receptor agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor_agonist)
  + [GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor_positive_allosteric_modulator)
    + [Alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol): a bad way to upregulate GABA receptors
    + [Benzodiazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine): a scary and possibly bad way to upregulate GABA receptors
  + [GABA-B receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAB_receptor)

Glutamate and glutamine are different but related. I'll sometimes supplement 10g of glutamine if I'm sluggish after I've been sick; I think the immune system consumes glutamine. Too much and I'll start to get irritable, I imagine due to excitotoxicity.


## Oxidation and antioxidants
+ [Oxidative stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress)
  + [ROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species): toxic byproducts of normal aerobic metabolism (e.g. homocysteine)
+ [Antioxidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant)
  + [Glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione): "the master antioxidant" (made from glutamate + glycine + cysteine and a big reason that sleep is important -- see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15472007/)
  + [Vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C)
  + [Vitamin E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E)
  + [Beta carotene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Carotene)


## Thyroid: basal metabolic control
+ [Thyroid hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones)
  + [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine)
  + [Iodine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_in_biology), the rate-limiting factor behind thyroid control
  + [Hypothyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism)
  + [Hyperthyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism)
+ [TSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone): causes the thyroid to produce T3 and T4, if tyrosine and iodine are available


## Monoamines: stuff that goes wrong sometimes
A lot of psychiatric medications modify these neurotransmitters directly. Because I'm doing this DIY, I prefer to be one degree removed by supplementing precursors that have a rate-limiting enzyme; for example, NDRIs (e.g. prescribed amphetamines) force higher dopamine levels, tyrosine (converted by a hydroxylase enzyme) supplies the precursor but allows the brain to downregulate tyrosine hydroxylase to maintain homeostasis.

+ [Monoamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter)
  + [Dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine): motivational salience
    + [Phenylalanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine), essential amino acid
    + [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine), nonessential amino acid derived from phenylalanine
    + [Tyrosine hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase): tyrosine -> [L-DOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA)
    + [AADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase): L-DOPA -> dopamine
    + [Dopamine beta-hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_beta-hydroxylase): dopamine -> norepinephrine
    + [NDRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor), e.g. methylphenidate (Ritalin), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and amphetamine
  + [Phenethylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine), endogeneous amphetamine-like chemicals
  + [Serotonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin): feeling good about stuff, sort of, but it's complicated
    + [Tryptophan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan)
    + [Tryptophan hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan_hydroxylase): tryptophan -> [5-HTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan)
    + [AADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase): 5-HTP -> serotonin (same as for dopamine)
    + [SSRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor)
+ [Monoamine oxidases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase)
  + [MAO-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_B), the enzyme that deactivates dopamine and phenethylamine
  + [Monoamine oxidase inhibitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor), antidepressants that deactivate MAO enzymes


## Caffeinated beverages and xanthines
+ [Xanthine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine)
  + [Theobromine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine), a metabolite of caffeine that doesn't cross the BBB
  + [Caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine), theobromine plus one methyl group (crosses BBB)
  + [Theophylline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophylline)
+ Xanthine-laden beverages
  + [Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee), which contains caffeine but no other xanthines ([SO answer about this](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2872/theobromine-in-coffee))
  + [Green tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea)
  + [Yerba mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)), my favorite kind of tea, and one that includes all three xanthines
  + [Matcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha), a green tea that naturally contains [theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine) (which I think everyone should be familiar with; see the NMDA section above and [here](alcohol-substitution.md))

My intuition is that xanthines, and really anything that increases basal metabolic rate, will cause the body to emit more ROS and therefore increase the need for antioxidants. I suspect it also increases required methylation throughput, which may be why caffeine raises homocysteine ([pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12450889/)).
