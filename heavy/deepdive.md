# Deep dive on affective states
**Heads up:** my goal is to narrate this in detail. I try to maintain an even tone -- hopefully I don't lean into the moods I'm describing as I write about them. But I also don't go easy on the subject matter because I think there's a case for getting into the full picture.

If that's not your thing, no worries: you can skip this page and the rest of the repo should make sense. I have a [summary page](../bond-scott.md) that covers the same set of stuff with less narration and detail. It should be lighter, easier reading but still informative.


## Contents
This page goes through five subtopics, intended to be read in order but possibly with some skips:

+ [Euthymic (normal) states](#euthymic-states)
+ [Depressive states](#depressive-states)
+ [Hypomanic states](#hypomanic-states)
+ [Manic states](#manic-states)
+ [Mixed-manic states](#mixed-mania), which carry the highest suicide risk

Each section starts with a quick summary of any content that I think might be a problem for some people to read.


## Euthymic states
I took a stupidly long time and collected a bunch of short YouTube clips that capture the UK mood scale as I've experienced it. TV clips are a good way to explore altered moods because they present surreal situations without the constraint of reality, often involving characters that are much more resilient than normal people. In our case, James Bond and Michael Scott.

+ **Euthymic (4):** [David Wallace in the hot tub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gYbZAAJtIE)
+ **Euthymic (5):** [Jim Halpert plays dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyWE-SmWp4)
+ **Euthymic (6):** [Bond drives a Ford and nothing exciting happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojob6IE4JQ4)

(4) starts off on the low end of normal. If you've watched _The Office,_ David Wallace is probably the most even-keeled character -- possibly too much to exemplify the low end of euthymia. But even level-headed, he's listless and unmotivated as he talks to Michael. He's not depressed, he just unfocused and unproductive.

Picking up from there, (5) has Jim neither especially driven nor passive. He's just living in the moment and doing his thing. Before I got myself straightened out I would have characterized this as a 6 or 7, but now I realize it's pretty average. It's easy to have fun and organize small stuff like this on a normal day.

Also note that (5)-state Jim doesn't ask himself "am I happy?". I've found out since being level that happy people rarely ask themselves this question. Happiness is going about your life without trying to enjoy it. So asking "am I happy" would be a good indicator that I'm feeling anhedonic or unmotivated.

(6) gets into "I feel capable; let's do stuff" territory. When I lean manic, I tend to become positively motivated and focused. Bond captures the mixture of self-assurance and intensity well. Bond in a Ford is realistic and grounded, but effortlessly cool. The dude's getting shit done and making it look easy -- not impaired nor superhuman, just calm and productive.


## Depressive states
**It should go without saying, but don't read this section if you have problems with depression.**

+ **Depressed (3):** [Daycare interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMTxLRxiiC8)
+ **Depressed (2):** [The roast of Michael Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS-utbiLy6o)
+ **Seriously depressed (1):** Michael Scott in [Diwali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTSg6vYJcxs)
+ **Seriously depressed (0):** Michael Scott in [Scott's Tots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0N2ZxQJYTw)

Depression is a mixture of cognitive impairment and anhedonia.

I think the daycare interview is close to how depression is commonly perceived, i.e. if you say "I have depression" I think it's what people would assume. It's an uncomfortable situation where minor things turn into major things and social interactions go sideways, and Jim and Pam might question their value in small ways.

The roast is worse: Michael is thoroughly uncomfortable, flails inarticulately, and nothing he does seems to work at all. I think normal people in this situation would seriously question their competence and their self-worth.

Diwali is where Michael starts to give up, which I think is the defining characteristic of severe depression. Once Carol turns him down he can't decide whether he wants to be a good person or not. He tries to kiss Pam not because it makes any sense (especially in context), but because he's trying to remind himself that any worthwhile life exists.

Scott's Tots is quite possibly the most depressing thing I've ever seen on television -- if you can't watch it, [you're not alone](https://reddit.com/r/cantwatchscottstots). I picked this clip because it so accurately captures the hopelessness, guilt, and fear that accompany severe depression. Michael's fate is sealed from the beginning; all that's left is for him to face the music, all of which hurts other people and is entirely his fault.

If you imagine Scott's Tots not as students but as Michael Scott being a failure of a parent, it's probably pretty clear why most people wouldn't survive this situation. Depression paints a similar picture where all of your past virtues work against you: _I've been living a lie and once my kids find out who I am, they'll be horrified_ -- that kind of thing. Depression is hard to shake off, just as it would be hard for Michael Scott to walk out of Scott's Tots and live a normal life, even if he suspected it to be materially false. It just happened and he just experienced it; that emotional state is still there. Conscious reasoning isn't very well equipped to dislodge something so visceral (although lithium and magnesium help tremendously).

Sorry to be a downer, but that's what it looks like. Depression sucks. It's unreal, but that isn't clear in the moment and it absolutely sucks.

The other end of the spectrum is equally unreal but a lot more fun.


## Hypomanic states
**It should go without saying, but don't read this section if you have problems with mania.**

+ **Hypomanic (7):** [Bond wins at poker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfx9bqc3fw)
+ **Hypomanic (8):** [Bond has unbelievable luck (SNL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpibPm7AVE)

(7) is the beginning of questionable judgment. I think we're supposed to see Bond being incredibly focused and competent, which he appears to be, but he's taking the risk a bit far. It works because he's Bond but you could easily imagine him losing and the scene indicting him for being reckless. It's kind of a coin toss.

He then confidently gets the girl in his newly-won car. When I watched the video, it didn't seem like this amount of confidence is quite comfortable for him; he looks like he's projecting a bit. I think that's accurate for hypomania: you're capable, but there's a bit of discrepancy between expectations and reality. If Bond were any normal person this would definitely be (8), but if we accept the premise that Bond is a totally capable super-guy I think it falls into (7).

I chose (8) because it captures the chaos that starts to set in on the upswing. Bond's decisions aren't awful but he's far from competent. His problem is that _everything_ is interesting; he doesn't have a robust sense of perspective anymore. There's an analog of this state that's useful for R&D work because it's easy to brainstorm a bunch of scattered solutions without getting too invested in any of them. Easy to start projects, impossible to finish them.


## Manic states
**It should go without saying, but don't read this section if you have problems with mania.**

+ **Manic (9):** [Bond invents _grand theft bulldozer_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxNbAwY_rk)

(9) sums up mania really well to me and I want to get into it point by point.

+ First, notice that Bond _feels_ very focused and driven. Without suspension of disbelief, the rest of the scene calls this judgment into question; I'll explain in a moment.
+ Second, Bond behaves like someone who's nearly impervious to damage. Bullets hitting the windshield? No problem. Mania involves a lot of epinephrine and that's exactly what it feels like.
+ Third, Bond doesn't care how much damage he causes. This is also consistent. Damage and collateral are not an issue next to the objective, whatever that happens to be. This is kind of a caricature, but it's the emotional side of things for sure.

The big problem is that Bond's judgment is all over the place: he steals a bulldozer for no reason, destroys a bridge, attempts jumps he has no ability to execute, and needlessly causes tens of thousands of dollars in property damage. This type of impairment is also consistent with what I've experienced in mania -- though obviously, I didn't make decisions that were this bad. In my (9)-level manic state I'd say my judgment was about ten beers compromised: not committing felonies but thoroughly making an ass of myself.

I also want to mention how accurate that clip is at depicting the physical aspect of mania. Normally I feel some degree of hesitation when considering anything that seems very dangerous. I think things like "that's gonna hurt" or "I don't want to run a mile" -- you know, normal people thoughts. Mania supplies enough adrenaline that none of this is an issue. Pain isn't really a thing; strength, energy, and coordination are ubiquitous, and obstacles like drywall feel like suggestions.

This frame of mind is why empathy doesn't work: pursuing the objective is the top priority, and because you're physically and emotionally invincible it's hard to imagine what it would feel like to be any other way. It's too easy to project your superhumanity onto others and then treat them like obstacles; nobody gets hurt because pain, fear, damage, and regret don't register as real. Rationalized empathy is still there, but doesn't work that well with this much cognitive impairment.

Mania is very physically taxing. I'd run on less than six hours of sleep a night and would usually lose several pounds over the course of a couple of weeks, then be depressed and comatose for a few months afterwards. I think it's also what causes long-term brain damage in unmedicated bipolar patients -- a lot like long-term amphetamine abuse. It was fun to feel that way sometimes, but honestly I don't miss the crazy extremes or the comedown. Post-medication I get the good parts: focus and some of the physical resilience, but without the impairment and depression.


## Mixed mania
**It should go without saying, but don't read this section if you have problems with mania, depression, or suicidal ideation.**

This section is also a bit more detailed than the others because I've found less about it online and want to create a more informative picture.

Mixed mania is considered to be the most dangerous psychological state, worse than depression and worse than unipolar mania. It's the biggest risk factor for bipolar people, numerically speaking, carrying a ~20-30% chance of suicide within one's lifetime.

I mentioned above that Scott's Tots would kill normal people. This isn't strictly true; by the numbers, depression makes people so disinclined to do anything that they don't commit suicide very often in practice even if they feel like they should.

Mixed mania, which is when I attempted suicide, is what happens if you take the hopelessness of Scott's Tots and mix it with the focus, drive, and terrible judgment of bulldozer-kleptomaniac Bond.

I was fortunate enough to be completely plastered when this happened. Joyce saw that I was in a fragile state of mind, hid all the knives in the house (with a decoy location and everything; she's sharp), and pinned me down somehow -- I don't entirely remember the arrangement. This wouldn't have worked if I had been sober; I'm half again her size, but since I was drunk I lost focus, got tired, and ended up going to sleep shortly thereafter. If I had been in this state sober or living alone I would be dead.

A quick aside: it's very likely that drinking caused this. I've never experienced something like it sober. I don't think it's chemically impossible or even that unlikely, but drinking causes specific deficiencies that seem likely to exacerbate mixed-manic tendencies. So if you're wondering whether staying sober that evening would have been safer, I'm almost certain it would have.

The most surreal part of the experience was waking up the next morning and feeling completely fine. No hangover and no residual feelings from the day before. I felt sharp, focused, and wanted to get things done. I remembered everything that happened but couldn't assign any emotional context to it -- sort of like if I had watched it in a movie but hadn't paid much attention.

In hindsight it's clear that I was still quite manic and out of my mind: I wanted to get back to my life and viewed Joyce's concern as being a nuisance. I dismissively told her she should have helped me-from-last-night kill myself because me-from-last-night was the type of shit human being that didn't need to live. She stared at me in disbelief and was despondent a large part of the day because she had no way to get through to me.

We ended up talking about it in more detail once the mania wore off a few days later. It took years and a lot of medication before I could understand the events as things I had driven. There were a number of other times when I wouldn't understand the emotional context of a memory, but this was the only one where I didn't remember it as me having agency. Maybe that's accurate: maybe agency really isn't there beyond some point of impairment. That's a hard conclusion for me because I don't like to conditionalize agency, but at the same time I don't have a good argument against it.

Medication prevents all of this from going sideways and that's why I'm as adamant as I am about having backup treatment plans to hedge against medical noncompliance.


## God damn that was hard to write
...and probably hard to read too. If you're still with me, sorry about that. The rest of this repo should be a lot easier.

I've tried to be accurate without over- or understating anything. Reading it back, I think this page captures it well. I'm not the best writer, though. It's taken me about half a dozen tries to frame it in a way that seems right. Hopefully this paints a picture that makes it easier to understand what's going on for people dealing with mental illness.
