# Bipolar in marriage
Bipolar has the questionable distinction of having [a whole reddit forum dedicated to significant others](https://reddit.com/r/bipolarsos). Their views of bipolar disorder are overwhelmingly negative, which I think is appropriate.

**TODO:** move this core principle into its own thing? There's a social-contract discussion common to both this and bipolar-work.

At its core I think the problem works like this: marriage, and any constructive partnership really, involves balancing individual autonomy and cooperation. Compatibility happens when one's individuality doesn't interfere with shared goals.

Bipolar disrupts this equation by compromising two important variables: emotional bonding and emotional self-sufficiency.


## Emotional bonding
Most intimate relationships are not motivated by quantitative reasoning: "I love you" is usually preferred over "I value you for strategic reasons, which I can readily enumerate". This becomes hard to navigate in the presence of emotional dysfunction; we aren't accustomed to breaking "I love you" into its constituent components and evaluating them individually. Unfortunately, bipolar demands that we do.

Prior to medication there were times when I couldn't emotionally identify with being married. I could rationally identify with it, sort of like if I had woken up in someone else's marriage and understood the virtues they saw in their partner. But emotionally it was someone else's partner and someone else's life. I felt like a newly-displaced single person who was responsible for maintaining someone else's family.

As you might imagine, this created several problems:

1. I'd begin to treat Joyce and the kids as burdens
2. I'd become escapist because I'd feel like I was missing romantic connection
3. The only think keeping my relationship together was the awareness that at some point I would be able to perceive it again, but I wouldn't know when

Joyce experienced (1) as me becoming cold and dismissive. I would lose myself in work as a way to distract myself from what felt like an empty and pointless life. The kids were probably too young to feel it. I would have a hard time living with myself now if they had been older and more perceptive.

(2) is complicated. If you imagine unpredictably waking up in someone else's life with no way to get back to your own, you would probably start to miss the people you had left behind. If you further consider that the people you left behind weren't real to begin with, you would probably want to get rid of your ill-fitting surroundings and rebuild your life from scratch.

I spent a lot of time fighting that impulse. Joyce and I were fortunate: I never left and wasn't unfaithful, although I had a short-lived emotional affair when I was manic and out of my mind. The substance of that affair wasn't that I was infatuated with someone, it was that my values had changed enough to justify deprioritizing Joyce in my life. It created trust issues that lingered for over a year as we looked back on the situation and tried to figure out what had gone wrong. Medication is the only reason we're still together; I don't think I have the integrity to maintain a marriage if my judgment isn't sound enough.

(3) drives the fundamental value conflict that undermines commitments. It's difficult to imagine a future in which you'll view the same people in an entirely different way. Without the awareness that your frame of mind is transient, the natural option is to try to fix the present. That leads to an ambiguity: do I discredit the "now" state, or do I discredit the thing I'll return to?
