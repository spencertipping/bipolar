# Bipolar at work
**Heads up: this has some depressing content. I've got another one of these tags on the section where it shows up.**

**TODO:** this page is more cynical than my views are. Rewrite it, but not early in the morning (when I tend to be in a more critical frame of mind).

This one is complicated for me to summarize because even without bipolar I'm just a strange person. I'm not sure how to attribute my career progression to mental illness vs mental weirdness, but some parts are obvious so I'll start with those.

In case my github profile didn't give it away, I'm a programmer. I've tended to work at startups doing off-beat, largely solo problems that didn't fit neatly into other departments. In a vacuum, my bias is digging below the commonly-accepted level of abstraction to question what gets taken for granted and find alternative strategies to solve problems. This results in unorthodox solutions that are sometimes crucial and are almost always difficult for others to maintain.

That bias isn't a bad one in my opinion. It's been tremendously useful, particularly in my not-at-work life where I do DIY projects and learn about different types of engineering. And I think it's a large part of why I'm valuable to companies I work for.

But it's also at the core of the conflicts I observe between myself and employers when I'm too impaired to mediate it into something constructive. Instead of being open-minded and creative, I come across as un-empathetic and overly critical. Other people's shortcomings aren't opportunities for me to be a helpful or supportive person, they're obstacles to productivity that I don't have the energy or patience to deal with.


## All's fair in love and work
I'm critical of parts of corporate culture on this page, so I wanted to contextualize it by stating my biases.

Perhaps controversially, I don't believe companies have any moral obligation towards their employees. I'm a big fan of at-will employment: anyone can walk for any reason, so every conflict is a matter of retention. That includes mental illness: I've never liked the idea that companies would view me as needing special protections. Maybe I'm weird, but my brain is my problem and not theirs. I can either justify my weirdness on the basis of providing value or I can't.

So when I indict some corporate norm for being irrational, there's no moral superiority behind it. Companies have the right to make decisions that I think are self-destructive or pointless. They may disagree, and I view it as morally correct for them to follow their own judgment when they do.


### Philosophical aside: why this worldview is awful
**TODO:** can I pack this down a bit? It seems extraneous even though I like having the hedge.

My worldview reeks of privilege because I'm selfish and lack perspective. I'm happy to appeal to individualistic consent-absolutism (which I genuinely value) to avoid hard moral questions about human dignity. Philosophically, this is as bankrupt as using freedom of speech to justify fraud.

A more visceral indictment is that my self-image is predicated on being intelligent and capable. I don't have a way to understand myself absent those attributes. Correspondingly, like most narcissists, I lack some basic empathy for people who are less self-sufficient. I'll say "let's create a UBI" as though the problem is isolated to economic policy, ignoring the larger issue that we confuse productivity for dignity.

All of this indifference towards my prior state of disability is morally consistent with my dissociated state the day after I attempted suicide. At some level it's self-nullifying to believe that you lack the fundamental qualities required to justify a dignified existence (and a monstrosity if you project those prejudices outwards). It isn't the type of world I want. If I had to guess, I suspect some analog of that conflict is intrinsically relatable to most people. I don't have an answer to it yet.

Anyway, amateur philosophy aside, let's get into the substance of why mental illness and work don't always mix.


## There's something going on
I don't imagine this is typical, but I'll get into it anyway.

I joined Factual (now Foursquare) in 2012 and dove straight into the bright new world of data science. This was before they had gotten into mobile ads; I was employee number 39 or 40 and they were building out their world-places index, a list of all businesses in every country. I was working remotely with a fantastic engineer, learning Clojure and Hadoop, and visualizing high-dimensional datasets. I was learning like crazy and it was the first job that was so engaging that I stopped writing open-source code after hours.

For some reason, I began to suspect that something mysterious/weird/suspicious was afoot on the executive team. I didn't know what it was, nor did I have any evidence that it existed. But I wanted to find out what was going on.

**TODO:** the rest of the story, which isn't much


## Corporate nice
**TODO:** soften this up and balance the narrative by describing the virtues of corporate nice

I like people who call corporate culture on its bullshit. One such freedom fighter is Steve Yegge, whose [cynical deconstruction of Google Cloud's deprecation policy and surrounding PR](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc) perfectly exemplifies a mood-disordered read on the broader space of office lingo. (Steve Yegge doesn't have a mental illness to my knowledge, I just like the way he reads between the lines.)

The problem is simple: corporations are made of people, yet certain degrees of humanity don't fit well into a corporate environment. So we put suits on monkeys and feign ubiquitous warmth by littering communications with non-sequitur "please" and "thank you". I have to think that neurotypical people tolerate this rather than embracing it, but either way it creates a challenging environment for anyone with compromised affect.

Take a simple email:

> Michael,
>
> In the future, please use sharepoint to report expenses.
>
> Thank you,
> Steve

Eminently professional, but emotionally opaque. I think we use something like Bayesian inference to assign affect to these things; sparing the math, that just means we'll interpret the emotional ambiguity according to our prior expectation. Altered moods influence this prior expectation substantially.


### Equally plausible interpretations
**Heads up: this section paints depression in a fairly graphic way. I wanted to narrate it accurately, but you should probably skip this if you have issues with depression.**

We can't use Steve's email to infer his mood towards us, so if we're at a mood 7 or 8 we might read it like this:

> Michael,
>
> Hey man, I know you're busy; just wanted to let you know we're on sharepoint now. I think we made the change like a week ago? Everyone's still getting tripped up on the new procedure. Funny story, I was the one pushing for it, and right after the meeting I did it the old way -- like just as we had decided the old way sucked. And then Susan from accounting did exactly the same thing. Old habits, right?
>
> Anyway, we've all got our fingers crossed that the new system is gonna be better once everyone's using it. By the way, let me know if it gives you any trouble. We tried to be careful about that, but we may have missed something and we really don't want to slow you down.
>
> Alright, I'll get out of your hair. Great debugging work the other day by the way; Sam told me all about it. Thanks again for being patient as we roll out the new system!
>
> Keep being awesome,
> Steve

A depressed reader will interpret it less warmly; at a 0 or 1 on the mood scale it would sound like this:

> Michael,
>
> What the fuck did you do. Why am I talking to you about process again. How do I still have to tell you about sharepoint. Are you a moron? Why the hell do you work here? Now I have to fix your stupid shit because you're such a dope that you can't follow basic directions about expense reporting. God you're dumb. If I weren't so busy sorting out your bullshit I'd be talking to your manager about how dumb you are.
>
> Please go fuck yourself because you're a waste of space and don't bother me with dumb shit like this again,
> Steve

Sorry to be a downer, but depression sucks and that's what everything sounds like. This is especially problematic when it comes to taking the day off work due to depression: my consistent fear was that my problem wasn't legitimate and this would be obvious to my manager and team, who would see it as me being lazy and selfish. More about this in "limiting liability" below.


### It's a hard problem
I don't know how to improve this. Even in the best-case scenario where the sender understands the recipient to have a problem with depression, they can't reasonably add whatever reassurances would disambiguate their intent. That approaches the fine line between soft-tone corporate-speak and soft-tone hitting-on-coworkers-speak, which demands a lot of discernment from the sender and adds needless risk.

**TODO:** think more


## Responding in kind
Receiving corporate-nice emails isn't the real problem with America. The real problem is when you have to write to someone else. This is where corporate nice turns into a gauntlet: we all understand what it sounds like, but like any human language it isn't codified anywhere. If your affect is AWOL, it's very difficult to understand what sounds sane and what doesn't. In fact, it's hard to anticipate what will even sound like _you_ when you're back to a normal mood.

Trying, failing, and worrying about projecting corporate nice is the biggest single issue I've faced as a result of having bipolar at work -- although it isn't the biggest reason I've been unproductive. That's described below. It's just been the largest point of stress, and I have no doubt that I've sent some emails or slack messages that have sounded at least a little deranged. My coworkers have been very kind on the occasions when it was noticeable.

I've often wanted a way to asynchronously communicate some type of "out of order" status: not that I can't get work done, but that if you talk to me I will sound bizarre in some way. Having a status page like this, and being able to socialize it easily, would have made my work experience much easier. It probably would have demanded more self-awareness than I had on a number of occasions, but my life also would have been less stressful.


## Limiting liability
Here's another related issue I ran into: let's suppose I wanted to break out of corporate nice for a moment and say "hey look, I'm seriously depressed today so I'm not going to sound normal." This creates a new problem: how many implicit expectations am I transferring to my employer?

Ideally none, but I don't want it to be ambiguous. So I'll feel a little compelled to say something like "don't worry, you don't have to do anything" -- but isn't that presumptive? If I'm depressed it definitely sounds that way.

After this kind of overthinking I'd often end up not sending anything at all. I'd quietly go to work and hope that nobody wanted to talk to me.

This problem was entirely my fault. Had I been thinking about it more clearly, I would have written up [email templates](emails.md) to deal with common situations.
