# Unreal emotional states from the inside
**Heads up: this page is rough.** You can skip it and everything else will make sense. I wrote it to make it easier to understand the _why_ behind bipolar behavior, which I think is rarely addressed in much detail, but there's no easy way to describe some parts.

I took a stupidly long time and collected a bunch of short YouTube clips that capture the range I've been through, which goes from 0 (depressed) to 9/10 (manic) on the [UK bipolar mood scale](https://www.bipolaruk.org/FAQs/mood-scale). TV clips are a good way to explore altered moods because they present surreal situations without the constraint of reality, often involving characters that are much more resilient than normal people. In our case there are two: James Bond and Michael Scott.


## Euthymic states

+ **Euthymic (5):** [Jim Halpert plays dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyWE-SmWp4)
+ **Euthymic (6):** [Bond drives a Ford and nothing exciting happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojob6IE4JQ4)

If you've seen the show, David Wallace is probably the most even-keeled character -- possibly too much to exemplify the low end of euthymia. But even level-headed, he's listless and unmotivated as he talks to Michael. He's not depressed, he just unfocused and unproductive. He latches onto a dumb idea and runs with it because it's _like_ having a purpose, but it really isn't the same and it doesn't make sense.

In other words, David Wallace isn't distressed, he's just a step or two away from being strategic and productive.

(5) picks up from there: Jim is neither driven nor passive. Before I got myself straightened out I would have characterized this as a 6 or 7, but now I realize it's pretty average. It's easy to have fun and organize small stuff like this on a normal day.

(6) gets into "I feel capable; let's do stuff" territory. When I lean manic, I tend to become positively motivated and focused. Bond captures the mixture of self-assurance and intensity well. Bond in a Ford is realistic and grounded, but effortlessly cool. The dude's getting shit done and making it look easy -- not impaired or superhuman, just calm and productive.


## Depressive states
**It should go without saying, but don't read this section if you have problems with depression.**

+ **Depressed (3):** [Daycare interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMTxLRxiiC8)
+ **Depressed (2):** [The roast of Michael Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS-utbiLy6o)
+ **Seriously depressed (1):** Michael Scott in [Diwali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTSg6vYJcxs)
+ **Seriously depressed (0):** Michael Scott in [Scott's Tots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0N2ZxQJYTw)

I think the daycare interview is close to how depression is commonly perceived, i.e. if you say "I have depression" I think it's what people would assume. It's an uncomfortable situation where minor things turn into major things and social interactions go sideways, and Jim and Pam might question their value in small ways.

The roast is worse: Michael is thoroughly uncomfortable, flails inarticulately, and nothing he does seems to work at all. I think normal people in this situation would seriously question their competence and their self-worth.

Diwali is where Michael starts to give up, which I think is the defining characteristic of severe depression. Once Carol turns him down he can't decide whether he wants to be a good person or not. He tries to kiss Pam not because it makes any sense (especially in context), but because he's trying to remind himself that any worthwhile life exists. I think anyone in this emotional state is a nontrivial suicide risk.

Scott's Tots is quite possibly the most depressing thing I've ever seen on television -- if you can't watch it, [you're not alone](https://reddit.com/r/cantwatchscottstots). I picked this clip because it so accurately captures the hopelessness, guilt, and fear that accompany severe depression. Michael's fate is sealed from the beginning; all that's left is for him to face the music, all of which hurts other people and is entirely his fault.

If you imagine Scott's Tots not as students but as Michael Scott being a failure of a parent (and living with it for the rest of his life), it's probably pretty clear why most people wouldn't survive this situation. Depression paints a similar picture where all of your past virtues work against you: _I've been living a lie and once my kids find out who I am, they'll be horrified_ -- that kind of thing. Depression is hard to shake off, just as it would be hard for Michael Scott to walk out of Scott's Tots and live a normal life, even if he suspected it to be materially false. It just happened and he just experienced it; that emotional state is still there. Conscious reasoning isn't very well equipped to dislodge something so visceral (although lithium helps tremendously).

Sorry to be a downer, but that's what it looks like. Depression sucks. It's unreal, but that isn't clear in the moment and it absolutely sucks.

The other end of the spectrum is equally unreal but a lot more fun.


## Manic states
**It should go without saying, but don't read this section if you have problems with mania.**

+ **Hypomanic (7):** [Bond has incredible luck (SNL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpibPm7AVE)
+ **Hypomanic (8):** [Drywall vs Daniel Craig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxNbAwY_rk)
+ **Manic/mixed manic (9):** same video but there's no bad guy; Bond just steals a bulldozer because he feels like a bad guy is probably there

I chose (7) because it captures the mostly-harmless chaos that starts to set in on the upswing. Bond isn't making terrible decisions, he's just losing himself too much to distraction. The problem is that _everything_ is interesting; he doesn't have a robust sense of perspective anymore. There's an analog of this state that's useful for R&D work because it's easy to brainstorm a bunch of scattered solutions without getting too invested in any of them. It's not great for getting focused work done though.

(8) sums up near-mania really well to me and I want to get into it point by point.

+ First, notice that Bond _feels_ very focused and driven. Without suspension of disbelief, the rest of the scene calls this judgment into question; I'll explain in a moment.
+ Second, Bond behaves like someone who's nearly impervious to damage. Mania involves a lot of epinephrine and that's exactly what it feels like.
+ Third, Bond doesn't care how much damage he causes. This is also consistent. Damage and collateral are not an issue next to the objective, whatever that happens to be. This is kind of a caricature, but it's the emotional side of things for sure.

The big problem is that Bond is far too impaired to do his job effectively: he steals a bulldozer for no reason, destroys a bridge, attempts jumps he has no ability to execute, and needlessly causes tens of thousands of dollars in property damage. This type of impaired judgment is also consistent with what I've experienced in mania (though obviously, I didn't make decisions that were this bad). In the real world I'd put this mental state at about a dozen beers' worth of compromised judgment: short of a felony but well past the point of embarrassing oneself.

I also want to mention how accurate that clip is at depicting the physical aspect of mania. Strength and coordination are maxed out, minor injuries don't matter, anything in the way can be moved or destroyed. Fear is nonexistent. Energy and resourcefulness are ubiquitous: anything that can be imagined can be physically realized with minimal effort. Seriously, mania is as close as I can imagine to being superhuman -- I'm not at all surprised that people use meth to get there.

This frame of mind is why empathy starts to fail: pursuing the objective is the top priority, and because you're physically and emotionally invincible it's hard to imagine what it would feel like to be any other way. It's too easy to project your superhumanity onto others and then treat them like obstacles; nobody gets hurt because pain isn't real.

As for (9), I've only been seriously manic once. When it happened it was basically (8)++ with a lot less mental coherence. Everything seemed similar -- I was incredibly driven and capable -- but I was convinced of two unreal things: (1) that my product idea was viable, and (2) that an unknown competitor was arbitrarily close to releasing a product that would destroy mine. I had no reason to believe either; it was all delusional thinking caused by some sort of chaotic feedback. I used any excuse to ignore regular life and live in crisis mode because it felt like my world was burning down and I had the ability to save it.

Mania is very physically taxing. I would usually lose several pounds over the course of a couple of weeks, then be irritable and comatose for a few months afterwards. I think it's also what causes long-term brain damage in unmedicated bipolar patients -- a lot like long-term amphetamine abuse. It was fun to feel that way sometimes, but honestly I don't miss the crazy extremes. I get enough of the good parts on medication that I'm not tempted to quit.


## Mixed mania
**It should go without saying, but don't read this section if you have problems with mania or depression.**

Mixed mania is widely considered to be the most dangerous psychological state, worse than depression and worse than unipolar mania. It's the biggest risk factor for bipolar people, numerically speaking, carrying a ~20-30% chance of suicide within one's lifetime.

I mentioned above that Scott's Tots would kill normal people. This isn't strictly true; by the numbers, depression makes people so disinclined to do anything that they don't commit suicide very often in practice even if they feel like they should.

Mixed mania, which is when I attempted suicide, is what happens if you take the hopelessness of Scott's Tots and mix it with the focus, drive, and terrible judgment of bulldozer-kleptomaniac James Bond. At that point you have self-indictment, urgency, and capability. You're James Bond on a mission but the bad guy is you.

I was fortunate enough to be completely plastered when this happened. Joyce saw that I was in a fragile state of mind, hid all the knives in the house (with a decoy location and everything; she's sharp), and pinned me down somehow -- I don't entirely remember the arrangement. This wouldn't have worked if I had been sober; I'm ten inches taller than she is and have a large physical advantage, but since I was drunk I lost focus, got tired, and ended up going to sleep shortly thereafter. If I had been sober or living alone I would be dead.

The most surreal part of the experience was waking up the next morning and feeling completely fine. No hangover and no residual feelings from the day before. I felt sharp, focused, and wanted to get things done. I remembered everything that happened but couldn't assign any emotional context to it -- sort of like if I had watched it in a movie but hadn't paid much attention.

In hindsight it's clear that I was still quite manic and out of my mind: I wanted to get back to my life and viewed Joyce's concern as being a nuisance. I dismissively told her she should have helped me-from-last-night kill myself because me-from-last-night was the type of shit human being that didn't need to live. She stared at me in disbelief and was despondent a large part of the day because she had no way to get through to me.

We ended up talking about it in more detail once the mania wore off a few days later. It took years and a lot of medication before I could remember the experience as anything I had actually lived through. In hindsight that's probably a good thing.


## God damn that was hard to write
...and probably hard to read too. If you're still with me, sorry about that.

I've tried to be accurate without over- or understating anything. Reading it back, I think this page captures it well. I'm not the best writer, though. It's taken me about a half dozen tries to frame it in a way that seems right.

If you're close to someone with bipolar disorder, their experiences are probably different -- but I suspect they have a lot in common with what I've described. Hopefully this paints a picture that makes it easier to understand what's going on.
