## Caffeinated beverages and xanthines
Not super relevant, but I've gotten some benefit from switching to yerba mate from coffee. Different beverages have different xanthine and antioxidant profiles that can change their metabolic impact to some degree.

+ [Xanthine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine)
  + [Theobromine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine), a metabolite of caffeine that doesn't cross the BBB
  + [Caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine), theobromine plus one methyl group (crosses BBB)
  + [Theophylline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophylline)
+ Xanthine-laden beverages
  + [Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee), which contains caffeine but no other xanthines ([SO answer about this](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2872/theobromine-in-coffee))
  + [Green tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea)
  + [Yerba mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)), my favorite kind of tea, and one that includes all three xanthines
  + [Matcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha), a green tea that naturally contains [theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine) (which I think everyone should be familiar with; see the NMDA section above and [here](alcohol-substitution.md))
  + **TODO:** black and oolong teas, although I don't have a lot of experience with them aside from pu'erh

My intuition is that xanthines, and really anything that increases basal metabolic rate, will cause the body to emit more ROS and therefore increase the need for antioxidants. I suspect it also increases required methylation throughput, which may be why caffeine raises homocysteine ([pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12450889/)).
