# I don't believe in sanity
I believe in _in_sanity, but I don't believe that there's intrinsic value in the mythos we create around the "sane mind". I do believe there's value in being consistent and well-reasoned. I've collected some thought experiments that inform my belief that "sanity" as we understand it is either rare or absent.

To make this page easier to follow, I put quotes around culturally-normative "sanity" when it's otherwise ambiguous.


## Why I care
"Sanity" is often held up as the desired endpoint of medical treatment. This could be xenophobia that undervalues neurodiversity, but I prefer to see it as a negligent overvaluation of neurotypical thought. "Normal" is confused with "functional" despite its many shortcomings.

When considering medication, my goal was never to converge to the set of blindnesses and limitations that typify normative sanity. Some of my neuroatypicalities were maladaptive, but I also had strengths. Not every deviation was a problem.

So I needed to go into medication with the understanding that I wasn't trying to be neurotypical. I was trying to think better and achieve my goals more reliably.


## Rhythm 0 and _Ex Machina_
**Heads up:** these thought experiments aren't comfortable. I don't things that cause or demonstrate dissonance tend to be. If anyone knows of a softer way to make this argument, please let me know.

**Also heads up:** there are minor spoilers for _Ex Machina_ in this section. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it.

Sane people don't reliably identify humanity. We assign humanity to things that _act_ human, whether or not we rationally understand them to be human.

[Rhythm 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_0) by Marina AbramoviÄ‡, a psychology experiment in performance art form, demonstrates that sane people will readily reclassify a person as non-human if that person behaves in a sufficiently unconventional way. The dissonance is shown at the end of the experiment: the audience is alarmed when the artist resumes human behavior -- but why? To a truly sane observer, her humanity was never in question and there is no moment of surprise.

People interpret the experiment differently. My view is that it demonstrates the inconsistency between what we know to be true and what we believe to be true; from a psychiatric perspective meets the criteria for [delusional psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis#Delusions).

What interests me is that nothing about the situation should have prompted this degree of disordered thought. Normal people can become psychotic in stressful or medically unusual circumstances, but neither is typical in an art museum. The only way I can understand this is as a built-in pathology that we go to some lengths to avoid in daily life, whether or not we're aware of our complicity or motive. In other words, we're only conditionally sane.

[_Ex Machina_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)) is similar but works the other way. The film is about a person who is presented with an obviously non-human machine that acts human. Does the person assign humanity to a machine knowing that it is a machine?

More than a fictional commentary, however, _Ex Machina_ became a Turing test for the broader audience as we began analyzing its commentary about women. I can understand it as a commentary about misogynistic men, but I can't understand it as being misogynistic itself because _there are no women in the movie_. Every character people describe as a woman is shown to be a machine, and we as the audience are expected to understand this.


### _Ex Machina_ interpretations are contentious, so here's my thought process
I can understand some dissonance around assigning humanity because it involves the [hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness): would a machine that emulates human behavior have experiences comparable to our own? If so, assigning humanity to the machine makes sense; although we understand the machine not to be human-as-organic, sentience is an acceptable substitute. That's fair and I can see sane people going either way.

The part that confuses me is that the film's robots are so reliably understood to be not just human, but specifically women. We aren't given any indication that the person creating these robots understands gender beyond superficial sex characteristics. If we're to believe that they experience life as women would, then we have to assume their misogynistic creator not only understands how gender identity works, but also understands women's subjective experience well enough to emulate it accurately in a machine.

No, the movie isn't about a man who holds himself to the much higher standard of solving the human-empathy-across-the-gender-divide problem but tells himself and the world that he's only playing the imitation game. It's about our willingness to assign human and gendered qualia to objects based on their apparent behavior, not their intrinsic mechanics. _Ex Machina_ is a Turing test for its characters and its audience.

(Alex Garland addresses some of these points in interviews, for instance [this one](https://www.vulture.com/2015/04/why-ex-machina-take-on-gender-is-so-advanced.html).)
