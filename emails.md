# Emails that are hard to write when affectively compromised
I go over this in more detail in [bipolar at work](heavy/bipolar-work.md), but the gist is that it can be hard to communicate in a corporate-acceptable way if one is sufficiently tweaked. I routinely had trouble with this.

## Crashing from depression, can't work today
I think it's important to say three things here:

1. Why you need to miss work
2. You're all set and can manage the problem
3. Aside from missing work, your employer doesn't need to worry about anything

None of these is easy to explain when you're depressed, so here's a template that summarizes it:

**TODO**

> Hey (name),
> I'm super depressed today and shouldn't come into work.
