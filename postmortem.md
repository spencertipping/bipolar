# Postmortem and future changes
Finding out you have a mental illness is a weird experience. The months immediately following were filled with questions, most of which amounted to figuring out where I could trust my brain and where I couldn't. I spent a lot of time replaying old memories with the awareness that my frame of mind was likely to be atypical.

All of this was further complicated by the fact that treatment wasn't instantaneous. It took me five or six iterations over the course of 18 months before I felt like I hit my stride medically. From there, I had to rebuild old habits to work with my new brain; I had a lot of counterproductive compensation strategies that no longer applied (like working obsessively in sprints, or underengineering projects).

...so it's been a long process. Totally worth it, but a lot of work.

I wanted to write this section because mental illness isn't all a bad thing.
