# Bipolar in marriage
Some people address topics like marriage, sex, politics, religion, etc, by not only holding unconventional views but openly discussing them with their name attached and with no expectation of reciprocal candor. I respect that tremendously, but am neither that courageous nor that awesome. I also don't want to apologize for having my limits: I think that it's generous to offer insight into aspects of one's private life, but by no means expected. Disclosure is, above all else, a free choice.

I say that because this section, more than others, is narrated in a conflicted way. On one hand, I want to describe specific interactions between close relationships and mental illness. I think there's a lot of substance to that conversation, and it's one of the places where mental illness has provided the most insight into how something has worked for neurotypical people.

On the other hand ... well, I mean the other hand's obvious, right? Anyway, I'll do my best to get into the meaningful issues without it being too much of a life story.


## War heroes
Bipolar has the questionable distinction of having [a whole reddit forum dedicated to significant others](https://reddit.com/r/bipolarsos). Their views of bipolar disorder are overwhelmingly negative, which I think is appropriate.
