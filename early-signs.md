# Early signs that something was amiss
Joyce didn't suggest bipolar disorder in a vacuum. She and many of my employers had tolerated quite a lot of abnormality from me. In hindsight, given the severity of it all, I'm amazed I was never fired or even given a negative performance review. Employers should probably up their game.

You can see a lot of this weirdness in projects and blog posts I wrote a long time ago. Some of the madness was constructive: [caterwaul JS](https://github.com/spencertipping/caterwaul), [ni](https://github.com/spencertipping/ni), [canard](https://github.com/spencertipping/canard), and many years of other similarly ambitious projects all began as manic sprints that changed who I was and what I could do. That's an example of bipolar gone right; had I been more sensible, I probably wouldn't have pushed myself so far out of my comfort zone, and I'd be less capable now.

I'll mention here that I've never done anything truly awful due to bipolar. If you do much reading on it, you'll find devastating stories about people who left their families behind, had ill-considered affairs, spent through their life savings, committed crimes, or worst, committed suicide. Joyce and I got my life figured out before anything came to that. The worst I've been through is an incompetent suicide attempt, less-than-stellar career performance, and some embarrassing but ultimately harmless social mistakes. I found it hard to respect myself because I had a lot of flaws that felt insurmountable, and I didn't understand how so many other people managed to keep their lives together so consistently.

I later discovered that my mind had been in decline for about a decade. I continued learning but executed fewer projects. This is typical of bipolar disorder: it's often neurodegenerative if left untreated, as repeated mania destroys the brain with excitotoxicity (ultimately leading to oxidative damage) and depression results in slower learning and impaired working memory.


## Bipolar at work
My managers often describe themselves as long-suffering. Boris, my manager at Factual, proudly proclaimed that he was my long-_est_ suffering manager after I had been there for four years. This is accurate, both in terms of longevity and misery.

It probably goes without saying, but I've never been indifferent to the well-being of my employers: insofar as I was awful it wasn't because I was trying to be. And to be fair, I wasn't that awful in the grand scheme of things either. But I had substantial weaknesses that complicated people's lives more than I wanted them to.

For example, I had a common pattern of picking up a project, running at it with maniacal fervor for about three weeks, then dropping it abruptly after hitting some relatively trivial roadblock. The issue wasn't the roadblock, of course, it was the fact that I had burned through my sprint of energy and saw a mountain in any molehill I encountered from that point onward.

This must have been maddening to people. From my perspective, I couldn't understand why I would lose all semblance of motivation for something overnight. It would have been frustrating, except that I didn't sense the loss very acutely since I no longer valued the project. I didn't understand the cause, so I assumed it was because I had found a problem with my prior strategy and was rethinking it.

There was a perverse upside to this work habit. During downtime when effort was expensive and I didn't care about anything, I'd slowly learn about a problem domain so I'd later be able to compress a whole project into a three-week burst of energy. I always found it much easier to _think_ than to _do_ when depressed. As a result, I know a lot of ways to execute projects quickly and I tend to know (and often write) tools that make me more efficient.

Bipolar often has this morally ambiguous quality, which is one reason it's complicated to write about. I'm hardly an apologist for mental illness, but I also want to look on the bright side and recognize that I'm a better person in some ways than I'd be otherwise; and in a world that increasingly values exceptionalism, or at least eccentricity, I suspect a neuroatypical disposition might wind up being a net positive (provided that medication is available to deal with the downsides).


### Professional composure
One particularly difficult thing for me was just showing up to work every day. That probably sounds weird, so I'll explain a bit.

If you go through my [Bond-Scott list of bipolar moods](bond-scott.md), you can probably imagine that it's difficult to socialize with people in certain states. So if you're on either deranged end of the spectrum, you'll probably lack the subconscious support required to present as sane. Because fundamentally you aren't sane.

I tended to worry about this more than it was an actual problem, but that probably saved me from some actual problems. It was widely understood that I was eccentric. One not-very-boring friend said I was the strangest person he knew by a decently wide margin. I never stayed in a normal job role for long; I've ended up being the guy-who-works-on-weird-projects in almost every company I've been at.

I was also more opinionated than was constructive. My opinions were often locally sensible but lacked perspective, meaning they weren't useful. This got worse over time; in my 20s it wasn't so much of an issue, but as I rounded 30 my mind was pretty far gone and I didn't have much to contribute. There was a recurring theme of me being frustrated with some process I viewed as being obstructive and finding increasingly bizarre ways to force a change. None of this was rational; it was me interpreting misplaced emotional impulses as reality and acting on them as such.

Finally, some of these emotional impulses masked legitimate inhibitions about what was professionally appropriate. To my credit, I have never hit on a coworker or jeopardized a company in any real way. But I have written pretty stupid blog posts, for instance "why I left Google", that didn't need to be written. If you look back over most of my old blog content, it's emotionally charged and sounds like it was written by a lunatic, largely because it was. Those were the only times I felt strongly enough about things to put them into writing, so that's what surfaced.

After the Google post went viral I wanted to delete it, but didn't because I didn't want to hide from having said those things (nor did I want the internet backlash from the Streisand effect). To be fair to myself, I don't think the post was written poorly. It could be improved a lot, but the indiscretion was in writing it at all, not in saying what I said.

I plan to go back and annotate those posts with some type of disclaimer about my state of mind at the time, knowing what I know now. Not that it makes much difference anymore, but I want to straighten out my end of the record by disclosing my narrative unreliability.


## Bipolar in marriage
...and probably relationships more broadly, but I've been married for 14 years so I'll address marriage.

There's an apocryphal statistic that 90% of bipolar marriages end in divorce. I haven't seen a reliable study that indicates this, although I think it's believable. Marriage is predicated on stability that bipolar people don't tend to have.

A more concrete way to understand the scope of the problem is to read people's accounts of dealing with a mentally ill spouse, for instance [BipolarSOs on reddit](https://reddit.com/r/bipolarsos), a forum dedicated to the purpose. I assume these are worst-case scenarios, but aspects ring true to my experience: Joyce found this forum and saw enough similarity to suggest I had bipolar disorder despite not matching the official criteria.

Broadly speaking, relationships and instability don't mix well for somewhat obvious reasons. In the limit case, being unstable is a form of losing identity, or at least integrity. We rely on invariants like "I want a family" and "I value _x_ qualities in my significant other". If your sanity is AWOL enough that suicide looks like a reasonable option, these things are probably negotiable enough to cause problems.

The result looks profoundly confusing and hurtful to the sane person in the relationship. I know this because Joyce and I have talked about it at length since. Joyce had every reason to believe that my intermittent indifference was deliberate, or at least indicative of some problem between us. In reality, it was as confusing to me as it was to her: one day I'd wake up feeling like I was living someone else's life with someone else's family (just like if you woke up in a good friend's body and were living their life; maybe you know what you're supposed to do, but it's still not who you are). That sense of otherness never entirely went away; I'd make a conscious choice to re-adopt Joyce and the kids as my family and move forward. I've done this every year or two, so everything has continued to work out.


### The April 2020 dissociation
I woke up on April 27 and everything was different. I didn't feel like myself at all; my mind seemed cluttered and disorganized, sort of like I had been homeless for a month but didn't remember it. I felt like I _should_ be homeless, like that was where I belonged and I didn't understand why I woke up in a home with people around. I knew I was supposed to have a family, of course, and who they were, and how I had gotten there, but it was exactly as disorienting as waking up from your life to find out you had been dreaming; you have a mixture of vague memories and jarring reminders that there's a whole other life you need to attend to.

In my case I wasn't up to it. I emailed my manager and team lead at Seeq that morning to let them know that I was going to be out for an indefinite amount of time, copying Joyce so she could take the lead on further communication.

I was comatose and dissociated for the next six weeks. It wasn't a bad time for me; I didn't care about anything and felt incredibly free. But I also didn't have any constructive ambition; my default plan was to become homeless and live under a bridge. When the plumbing clogged up, Joyce and I stayed with her parents for a month because I was too disengaged to manage any logistics. (Her dad and I drove back for a week and did a bunch of plumbing, electrical, and structural work; I was still checked out but we had a great time.)

I improved slowly over the course of May. Part of that involved realizing that I was depressed, even though this time it didn't come with the usual dysphoria. (There are at least two axes of depression/mania: dysphoria ↔ euphoria, which is what it feels like, and avolition ↔ lack of inhibition, which is how easy it is to do things.)

Towards the end of May Joyce insisted that I try DHEA, which I did and it improved things significantly. I also began taking 10g/day of tyrosine, which helped so much that I've never stopped. I was full of energy throughout June, which was unusual for me. At first I thought it was due to the tyrosine→dopamine pathway, but in hindsight I suspect it was thyroid hormone instead. I seem to have thyroid dysregulation when the seasons change.


### Long-term relationships without reliable emotional attachment
I think bipolar disorder qualifies as a hardware defect for the purposes of long-term relationships -- so how do you work with that? (Pro tip: reducing family life to a business proposition _never works:_ it is a loss-making venture no matter how creatively you do the accounting.)

If you ask most couples why they're together, you tend to hear a mixture of qualities like "smart, kind, funny, good at _x_ thing". These obviously describe a much more specific picture, but like Potter Stewart most people know it when they see it; quantifying compatibility isn't so important. Stable attachment doesn't cause you to question these things very much, or so I tend to assume.

Since I'm starting from a more dismissive-avoidant disposition, stability is consciously engineered at some level. It makes sense to find ways to commit to people you value; I think the main challenge is to ground it out to concrete elements that don't depend on emotional hysteresis.

**TODO:** I'm not sure what I'm trying to explain in this section. I think there's something worth saying, but I'm not sure this is it. Or maybe it's all obvious and I'm overthinking it? Not sure.
