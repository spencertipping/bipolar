# Early signs that something was amiss
Joyce didn't suggest bipolar disorder in a vacuum. She and many of my employers had tolerated quite a lot of abnormality from me. In hindsight, given the severity of it all, I'm amazed I was never fired or even given a negative performance review. Employers should probably up their game.

You can see a lot of this weirdness in projects and blog posts I wrote a long time ago. Some of the madness was constructive: [caterwaul JS](https://github.com/spencertipping/caterwaul), [ni](https://github.com/spencertipping/ni), [canard](https://github.com/spencertipping/canard), and many years of other similarly ambitious projects all began as manic sprints that changed who I was and what I could do. That's an example of bipolar gone right; had I been more sensible, I probably wouldn't have pushed myself so far out of my comfort zone.

I'll mention here that I've never done anything truly awful due to bipolar. If you do much reading on it, you'll find devastating stories about people who left their families behind, had ill-considered affairs, spent through their life savings, committed crimes, or worst, committed suicide. Joyce and I got my life figured out before anything came to that. The worst I've been through is an incompetent suicide attempt, less-than-stellar career performance, and some embarrassing but ultimately harmless social mistakes. I found it hard to respect myself because I had a lot of flaws that felt insurmountable, and I didn't understand how so many other people managed to keep their lives together so consistently.

I later discovered that my mind had been in decline for about a decade. I continued learning but executed fewer projects. This is typical of bipolar disorder: it's often neurodegenerative if left untreated, as repeated mania destroys the brain with excitotoxicity and depression results in slower learning and impaired working memory.
