# Early signs that something was amiss
Joyce didn't suggest bipolar disorder in a vacuum. She and many of my employers had tolerated quite a lot of abnormality from me. In hindsight, given the severity of it all, I'm amazed I was never fired or even given a negative performance review. Employers should probably up their game.

You can see a lot of this weirdness in projects and blog posts I wrote a long time ago. Some of the madness was constructive: [caterwaul JS](https://github.com/spencertipping/caterwaul), [ni](https://github.com/spencertipping/ni), [canard](https://github.com/spencertipping/canard), and many years of other similarly ambitious projects all began as manic sprints that changed who I was and what I could do. That's an example of bipolar gone right; had I been more sensible, I probably wouldn't have pushed myself so far out of my comfort zone.

I'll mention here that I've never done anything truly awful due to bipolar. If you do much reading on it, you'll find devastating stories about people who left their families behind, had ill-considered affairs, spent through their life savings, committed crimes, or worst, committed suicide. Joyce and I got my life figured out before anything came to that. The worst I've been through is an incompetent suicide attempt, less-than-stellar career performance, and some embarrassing but ultimately harmless social mistakes. I found it hard to respect myself because I had a lot of flaws that felt insurmountable, and I didn't understand how so many other people managed to keep their lives together so consistently.

I later discovered that my mind had been in decline for about a decade. I continued learning but executed fewer projects. This is typical of bipolar disorder: it's often neurodegenerative if left untreated, as repeated mania destroys the brain with excitotoxicity and depression results in slower learning and impaired working memory.


## Bipolar at work
My managers often describe themselves as long-suffering. Boris, my manager at Factual, proudly proclaimed that he was my long-_est_ suffering manager after I had been there for four years. This is accurate, both in terms of longevity and misery.

It probably goes without saying, but I've never been indifferent to the well-being of my employers. In other words, insofar as I was awful it wasn't because I was trying to be. And to be fair, I wasn't that awful in the grand scheme of things either. But I had substantial weaknesses that complicated people's lives more than I wanted them to.

For example, I had a common pattern of picking up a project, running at it with maniacal fervor for about three weeks, then dropping it abruptly after hitting some relatively trivial roadblock. The issue wasn't the roadblock, of course, it was the fact that I had burned through my sprint of energy and saw a mountain in any molehill I encountered from that point onward.

This must have been maddening to people. From my perspective, I couldn't understand why I would lose all semblance of motivation for something overnight. It would have been frustrating, except that I didn't sense the loss very acutely since I no longer valued the project.

There was a perverse upside to this work habit. During downtime when effort was expensive and I didn't care about anything, I'd slowly learn about a problem domain so I'd later be able to compress a whole project into a three-week burst of energy. I always found it much easier to _think_ than to _do_ when depressed. As a result, I know a lot of ways to execute projects quickly and I tend to know (and often write) tools that make me more efficient.

Bipolar often has this morally ambiguous quality, which is one reason it's complicated to write about. I'm hardly an apologist for mental illness, but I also want to look on the bright side and recognize that I'm a better person in some ways than I'd be otherwise.


### Professional composure
One particularly difficult thing for me was just showing up to work every day. That probably sounds weird, so I'll explain a bit.

If you go through my [Bond-Scott list of bipolar moods](bond-scott.md), you can probably imagine that it's difficult to socialize with people in certain states. So if you're on either deranged end of the spectrum, you'll probably lack the subconscious support required to present as sane. Because fundamentally you aren't sane.

I tended to worry about this more than it was an actual problem, but that probably saved me from some actual problems. It was widely understood that I was eccentric. One not-very-boring friend said I was the strangest person he knew by a decently wide margin. I never stayed in a normal job role for long; I've ended up being the guy-who-works-on-weird-projects in almost every company I've been at.

I was also more opinionated than was constructive. My opinions were often locally sensible but lacked perspective, meaning they weren't useful. This got worse over time; in my 20s it wasn't so much of an issue, but as I rounded 30 my mind was pretty far gone and I didn't have much to contribute. There was a recurring theme of me being frustrated with some process I viewed as being obstructive and finding increasingly bizarre ways to force a change. None of this was rational; it was me interpreting misplaced emotional impulses as reality and acting on them as such.

Finally, some of these emotional impulses masked legitimate inhibitions about what was professionally appropriate. To my credit, I have never hit on a coworker or jeopardized a company in any real way. But I have written pretty stupid blog posts, for instance "why I left Google", that didn't need to be written. If you look back over most of my old blog content, it's emotionally charged and sounds like it was written by a lunatic, largely because it was. Those were the only times I felt strongly enough about things to put them into writing, so that's what surfaced.

After the Google post went viral I wanted to delete it, but didn't because I didn't want to hide from having said those things (nor did I want the internet backlash from the Streisand effect). To be fair to myself, I don't think the post was written poorly. It could be improved a lot, but the indiscretion was in writing it at all, not in saying what I said.

I plan to go back and annotate those posts with some type of disclaimer about my state of mind at the time, knowing what I know now. Not that it makes much difference anymore, but I want to straighten out my end of the record by disclosing my narrative unreliability.


## Bipolar in marriage
...and probably relationships more broadly, but I've been married for 14 years so I'll address marriage.

To my knowledge, there's an apocryphal statistic that 90% of bipolar marriages end in divorce. I haven't seen a reliable study that indicates this, although I think it's believable.

A more concrete way to understand the scope of the problem is to read people's accounts of dealing with a mentally ill spouse, for instance [BipolarSOs on reddit](https://reddit.com/r/bipolarsos), a forum dedicated to the purpose. I assume these are worst-case scenarios, but aspects ring true to my experience: Joyce found this forum and saw enough similarity to suggest I had bipolar disorder despite not matching the official criteria.

Broadly speaking, relationships and instability don't mix well for somewhat obvious reasons. In the limit case, being unstable is a form of losing identity, or at least integrity. We rely on invariants like "I want a family" and "I value qualities in my significant other". If your sanity is AWOL enough that suicide looks like a reasonable option, these things are probably negotiable enough to cause problems.

All of this looks profoundly confusing and hurtful to the sane person in the relationship. I know this because Joyce and I have talked about it at length since. None of it came from a hurtful place on my end -- just as most people can't introspect why they stay in love with someone, I couldn't understand why parts of it would sometimes be absent -- but that lack of understanding made it hard for me to explain what was going on. Joyce had every reason to believe that my intermittent indifference was deliberate, or at least indicative of some problem between us. Neither of us understood what it was.

**TODO:** figure out what I want to say in this section, possibly add more stuff
