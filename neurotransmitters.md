# Background reading on neurotransmitters and metabolism
Here's a list of Wikipedia and pubmed articles I found to be most helpful when designing a treatment strategy for my bipolar symptoms. Again, not authoritative or complete, just some starting points I used to figure things out.


## The five-minute version
**TODO:** re-review this section to make sure it summarizes the rest (and maybe start by fleshing everything else out first)

If you don't have time to read everything, here's (in my opinion) the most important stuff to know about:

+ [MTHFR enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase), the methionine cycle, and hyperhomocysteinemia -- common failure points if you have an MTHFR mutation (can be addressed with methylfolate, but read more before doing this long-term)
+ [Lithium aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aspartate), an OTC form of lithium that, IMO, is safe and everyone should take at 5mg/day or more (I take 40mg/day)
+ [Glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione): "the master antioxidant" (made from glutamate + glycine + cysteine), limited by cysteine availability
+ [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine): the amino acid precursor to dopamine, melanin, and thyroid hormone -- I take 10g/day, which is a lot
+ [This page about alcohol, GABA, and NMDA](alcohol-substitution.md), which covers what I think should be common cultural knowledge about (and alternatives to) GABA-ergic drugs like alcohol and benzos


## Lithium: trace mineral for neurotransmitter regulation
I have an ax to grind here: I really think lithium is an essential trace mineral, and I think people take humongous amounts for psychiatric disorders and suffer through major side effects when smaller amounts would get a lot of the benefit and none of the problems. I'm not alone in suspecting these things; a number of studies have come out in support of this view ([like this one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30605431/)).

Due to its unfortunate history lithium has a far worse reputation than I think it deserves, especially in small quantities. I take 40mg/day to think more clearly and have no side effects (although there were some short-term ones when I started; see below). I suspect most people would benefit from 5mg/day, which is on the high side of what you might encounter in groundwater. These levels are completely safe for long-term use; none of the documented side effects kick in until you're at 30-100x this amount.

It's often prescribed in much higher doses for bipolar and other disorders; prescriptions range anywhere from 900mg-1800mg/day of lithium carbonate (~150mg-300mg of elemental lithium, if I remember right). This is why it causes problems for people. I haven't found any documented risks related to microdosing, and several articles have suggested it's neuroprotective.

+ [Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))
  + [Texas study suggesting that lithium is a trace nutrient](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1699579/)
  + [Japanese study associating trace lithium with lower suicide risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19407280/)
  + [Lithium aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aspartate), an OTC and, in my opinion, safe supplement I've used since September 2019 with no issues

**Note about initial side effects:** I got very absent-minded for a couple of weeks when I started on even a small amount of lithium (2mg/day). I also felt nauseous for about 30min after each dose.

These side effects both went away in a week or two. The absent-mindedness turned out to be the feature, not a bug: I had grown accustomed to keeping track of thoughts by obsession, not by habit. Lithium prevented ideas from lingering if I wasn't thinking about them. I had to get used to this and learned to actively remember things. Now it's awesome and I would never go back: I'm much more deliberate and focused, and I never have nagging or obsessive thoughts.

Joyce reminded me that I started taking NAC shortly after starting lithium; that made a big difference. I don't know why this would be the case (glutathione deficiency maybe?), but apparently I was about to quit after the first week because I was unproductive and NAC saved the day. I do know that NAC has helped me be much more calm, alert, and energetic.


### Relative safety of different lithium salts
+ [Lithium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_carbonate): controlled substance, widely studied and considered to be safe
+ [Lithium aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aspartate): OTC; [aspartic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid) has been studied extensively and is considered reasonably safe, but not lithium aspartate specifically
+ [Lithium orotate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_orotate): OTC; [orotic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orotic_acid) may be related to urea cycle pathologies, but hasn't been thoroughly studied
+ [Lithium citrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_citrate): OTC; [citric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid) is completely safe, but lithium citrate is expensive and requires refrigeration

I use lithium aspartate because the amount of aspartic acid I get from it is comparable to what's in two or three avocados. I've heard health concerns about avocados on the grounds that they're too calorie-rich or that they turn people into millennials, but never because of aspartate so I assume it's fine.

If aspartate were unavailable, I would use orotate or citrate with no hesitation. My risk profile is much more about avoiding lithium deficiency than it is about any supposed risks associated with orotic acid.


## Methylation: general metabolism and oxidative stress
**I highly recommend finding your MTHFR status.** You can find this out using a home DNA sequencing service like 23AndMe.

**TODO:** the CBS enzyme rate-limits the Hcy transsulfuration pathway. It's worth a mention here, as it's more decisive than MTHFR for many people (and this may be why Hcy, not C677T, was the predictive factor in the heroin dependence study).

MTHFR mutations are relatively common (~1% in sub-saharan Africans, ~10% in caucasians, ~20% in Italians and Hispanics) and linked to a number of mental illnesses including schizophrenia, depression, and autism.

MTHFR is the subject of a lot of internet speculation right now, not all of which is valid because the internet is a dumpster fire. [Here's an article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/holistic-psychiatry/201711/mthfr-methylation-and-histamine-in-psychiatric-conditions) cautioning against assuming too much and going through some characteristic symptoms of over- and under-methylation.

Here's a picture of the methionine cycle for context:

![methionine cycle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/MTHFR_metabolism.svg/2880px-MTHFR_metabolism.svg.png)

(By Epgui - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=31804170)

+ [Methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation), relevant for reducing oxidative stress if you have an MTHFR mutation (I have C677T)
  + [MTHFR enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase)
  + [MTHFR deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase_deficiency)
  + [Methylfolate or 5-MTHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levomefolic_acid), produced by MTHFR enzyme, which is being studied as an [adjunctive antidepressant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levomefolic_acid#Major_depressive_disorder) when combined with SSRIs and SNRIs
  + [C677T variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rs1801133), linked to schizophrenia, depression, and autism
  + [Homocysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine), most importantly the [methionine cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine#/media/File:MTHFR_metabolism.svg)
  + [Hyperhomocysteinemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhomocysteinemia), the reason I was anxious and miserable -- ([pubmed on Hcy and alcohol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10905999/), [pubmed on Hcy and coffee/caffeine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12450889/))
+ [Oxidative stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress)
  + [ROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species): toxic byproducts of normal aerobic metabolism (e.g. homocysteine)
+ [Antioxidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant)

  + [Vitamin E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E)
  + [Beta carotene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Carotene)

**Note:** homocysteine is used for multiple things in the body, including glutathione synthesis (via the trans-sulfuration pathway as an indirect cysteine source, see [this pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12631446/) for example). I supplement [NAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) as a substitute to supply cysteine in case my methylation adjustments result in too much Hcy->Met conversion.


## Thyroid: basal metabolic control
+ [Thyroid hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones)
  + [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine), the base amino acid of thyroid hormone (and dopamine)
  + [Iodine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_in_biology), the rate-limiting factor behind thyroid hormone production
  + [Hypothyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism)
  + [Hyperthyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism)
  + [Hashimoto's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashimoto%27s_thyroiditis): 5% occurrence in caucasians
+ [TSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone): causes the thyroid to produce T3 and T4, if tyrosine and iodine are available


## NMDA receptors: up- and down-regulating neurotransmission
These are a big deal and are a bit confusing. NMDA receptors have two binding sites, the glycine site and the glutamate site. However, other substances can activate each:

+ The glycine site can be activated by glycine or, more potently, D-serine
+ The glutamate site can be activated by glutamate or, less potently, aspartate

There's a whole section on this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor#Ligands).

NMDA receptors are influenced by a lot of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, benzodiazepines, PCP, DXM, ketamine, N₂O, and probably more.

Additionally, NMDA receptors, neuron activation voltages, and trace minerals are related:

> Activation of NMDA receptors results in the opening of an ion channel that is nonselective to cations, with a combined reversal potential near 0 mV. While the opening and closing of the ion channel is primarily gated by ligand binding, the current flow through the ion channel is voltage dependent. Extracellular magnesium (Mg2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions can bind to specific sites on the receptor, blocking the passage of other cations through the open ion channel. Depolarization of the cell dislodges and repels the Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions from the pore, thus allowing a voltage-dependent flow of sodium (Na+) and small amounts of calcium (Ca2+) ions into the cell and potassium (K+) out of the cell.

+ [NMDA receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor)
  + [Excitotoxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity), particularly due to [glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter))
    + [Glutamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine), which is metabolized to glutamate (I think after it crosses the BBB)
    + [Theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine): a safe and neuroprotective glutamate antagonist found in matcha tea that I think everyone should be familiar with (I discuss it in the context of alcohol use [here](alcohol-substitution.md))
  + [GABA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid), the NMDA inhibitor (relaxant) people upregulate with alcohol and benzodiazepines
  + [GABA receptor agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor_agonist)
  + [GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor_positive_allosteric_modulator)
    + [Alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol): a bad way to upregulate GABA receptors
    + [Benzodiazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine): a scary and possibly bad way to upregulate GABA receptors
  + [GABA-B receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAB_receptor)

Glutamate and glutamine are different but related. I'll sometimes supplement 10g of glutamine if I'm sluggish after I've been sick; I think the immune system consumes glutamine. Too much and I'll start to get irritable, I imagine due to excitotoxicity.


## Monoamines: stuff that goes wrong sometimes
A lot of psychiatric medications impact these neurotransmitters directly, for instance by [inhibiting reuptake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor), [deactivating enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor), or [modifying receptor site behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosteric_modulator). Because I'm doing this DIY, I prefer to be one degree removed by supplementing precursors that have a rate-limiting enzyme; for example, NDRIs (e.g. prescribed amphetamines) force higher dopamine levels, tyrosine (converted by a hydroxylase enzyme) supplies the precursor but allows the brain to downregulate tyrosine hydroxylase to maintain homeostasis. I provide more context for this approach [in this section](diy-medicine.md#efficacy-studies-and-homeostatic-regulation).

**Note:** [Choline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline), or more precisely [acetylcholine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine), is a big deal as neurotransmitters go. I've tried supplementing it a few times and always got super depressed, so I don't know how it plays into bipolar disorder. It also isn't a monoamine so it isn't in the list here. But it should be on your mind if you're studying neurotransmitters and how to change them, I just don't know much about it beyond that.

**Update:** I can now take CDP choline without getting depressed at all. I get a bit more grim/focused, but not dysphoric. Not sure what changed, but it's possible it had to do with getting tyrosine→dopamine working correctly first? (**TODO:** link in the diagram Joyce found about the relationship between CDP, phosphatidylcholine, and GPC)

+ [Monoamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter)
  + [Dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine): motivational salience
    + [Phenylalanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine), essential amino acid
    + [Tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine), nonessential amino acid derived from phenylalanine
    + [Tyrosine hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase): tyrosine -> [L-DOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA)
    + [AADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase): L-DOPA -> dopamine
    + [Dopamine beta-hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_beta-hydroxylase): dopamine -> norepinephrine
    + [NDRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor), e.g. methylphenidate (Ritalin), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and amphetamine
  + [Phenethylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine), endogeneous trace amphetamine-like chemicals
    + [Substituted amphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine)
  + [Serotonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin): feeling good about stuff, sort of, but it's complicated
    + [Tryptophan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan)
    + [Tryptophan hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan_hydroxylase): tryptophan -> [5-HTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan)
    + [AADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase): 5-HTP -> serotonin (same as for dopamine)
    + [SSRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor)
+ [Monoamine oxidases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase)
  + [MAO-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_B), the enzyme that deactivates dopamine and phenethylamine
  + [Monoamine oxidase inhibitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor), antidepressants that work by deactivating MAO enzymes

Note that AADC, the shared decarboxylase enzyme for both dopamine and serotonin, consumes B6 as a cofactor and is built using lysine. I naturally converge towards a high-lysine diet: lots of eggs, lean meat, Greek yogurt, that kind of thing. I'm experimenting with direct lysine supplementation to see if that changes my dietary preferences (I'm probably getting too many calories from protein).

**Minor update:** I'm back to eggs + salmon + pepperjack for breakfast, from eggs + peas before. Definitely gravitating towards high-lysine stuff, though now I wonder whether the causation goes the other way: high protein → high lysine demand. No idea. That's with 1-2g of lysine HCl daily.

**Further update:** lysine was a red herring. I gravitated towards a high-protein diet because my glycolysis wasn't functioning well, so I was breaking down amino acids for energy (possibly using the acetyl groups from NAC for Krebs cycle?). This is a problem because it produces ammonia. I've increased B1, B5, B6, and zinc and rearranged macros so I get most of my calories from simple carbohydrates. This seems to be working so far.

**TODO:** a more detailed postmortem on glycolysis optimization


## Secosteroids
There's a body of research on a potential connection between bipolar disorder and sex hormone dysregulation. I don't have symptoms of low testosterone when euthymic, or in general, but I do when depressed. Here's some reading about this that I've found so far:

+ [Low testosterone in bipolar men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27703738/)
+ [Statistically insignificant testosterone fluctuation within bipolar I](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29887899/)
+ [SSRIs may increase testosterone in both women and men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22325700/)

This is what led me to try DHEA as an acute antidepressant, which seemed to work well.

+ [Steroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid)
  + [Secosteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secosteroid)
    + [Vitamin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D)
  + [Cholesterol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol)
  + [Neurosteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosteroid)
    + Of note, this class of chemicals includes many GABA-A positive and negative allosteric modulators
    + [DHEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone)


## B vitamins: oddly relevant to neurotransmitters
If I understand this correctly, vitamins A, C, D, E, and K2 have relatively minor roles in the brain to the extent that they apply at all. Some B vitamins, however, are cofactors for all kinds of enzymes directly involved in neurotransmitter production.

+ [B vitamins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins)
  + More general-metabolic than neurological
    + [B1 (thiamine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine): glucose and lipid metabolism
    + [B2 (riboflavin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin): indirectly involved in [5-MTHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levomefolic_acid) production, as a cofactor for [FAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide) synthesis (see [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin#Function) for details)
    + [B3 (niacin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B3): general metabolic stuff, can be deficient in alcoholics ([pellagra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellagra))
    + B4 does not exist for some reason
    + [B5 (pantothenic acid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantothenic_acid)
    + [B7 (biotin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin)
    + B8 does not exist for some reason
  + Neurotransmitter cofactors
    + [B6 (pyridoxine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6): activates to PLP, which is an AADC cofactor for dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, GABA, and histamine; it also does other important stuff (so it's a big deal)
    + [B9 (folate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate): works in conjunction with B12 to remethylate homocysteine, related to [neurological disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate#Neurological_disorders)
    + B10 and B11 aren't a thing
    + [B12 (cobalamin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12): trades methyl groups with folate during Hcy->Met, and deficiency can be masked by MTHF supplementation

**NOTE:** if you have an MTHFR mutation, folic acid is useless and may be problematic in large quantities. See [MTHFR deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase_deficiency#Management) for details. I mention this because folic acid is a source of folate for most people, but MTHFR deficiency prevents it from being activated into the methionine cycle.

Here's another diagram of the methionine cycle, this time from the folate/B12 perspective:
