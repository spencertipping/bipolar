# Open source bipolar disorder
**Work in progress**

**TODO:** the narrative tone is coming together, but it still needs work. Particularly on the new sections. I think it sounds uneven or overly critical in some parts.

**TODO:** the time I spend on each issue doesn't reflect importance very well yet.

**TODO:** trim down this intro

**TODO:** I probably need to re-outline stuff once I'm done exploring new discussions. I don't think this README is a very good table of contents.

**TODO:** fix broken/misleading links (I've moved some content since referring to it)

Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder. I probably have for most of my adult life, which was a surprise that kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which has been straightforward.

I've wanted to write about it ever since the diagnosis, but it's not an easy topic for me to address. The biggest obstacle isn't that I'm unwilling to talk about it; that's actually very easy for me. The hard part is maintaining enough emotional composure to discuss it without sounding like a lunatic. I spend most of my time being an engineer, which means (1) I'm not a great writer; and (2) I usually write about emotionally un-demanding things.

So this whole project is, in that sense, outside my comfort zone. Sorry in advance for the uneven quality.

As for why it exists, it's for the same reasons I write open-source software. Whenever I solve a hard problem and learn something, I want to publish the solution so others have more to work with. Different people will solve similar problems in different ways, but if more of those ways are explained then the world is easier to navigate.

Given that, **this writeup is intentionally subjective.** Even when I don't phrase things that way, that's how I intend it. My main goal is to describe my experience, reasoning process, and how I relate to it all in hindsight -- and to preserve as much detail as I can. Not everyone with bipolar disorder will see things the same way, nor will many of my decisions make sense for other people. Like any open-source project, I welcome feedback. You can email me or file a github issue; I'll respond to both.

This writeup also covers some hard topics, plumbing the depths of depression and that sort of thing. I've tried to indicate ahead of time when you'll encounter these sections so you can skip over them, and where possible I've tried to provide lighter alternatives to make up any missing context. I don't think they're bad sections or poorly written, but I think they aren't for everyone. If you read this writeup repeatedly and never touch some sections, I think that's appropriate; it's what I had in mind when writing it.

(If you clone the project locally, hard topics are in `heavy/`; everything else should be easy reading.)

Mental illness has different facets: medical, social, philosophical. I'm not qualified to address any of these, but that's never slowed me down before. I've tried to split my thought process into these categories and keep minimal dependencies between them.

**TODO:** figure out whether I like the below section ordering


## Medical perspective
In case it's unclear, I'm not a doctor and nothing I say is medical advice. I do have a medical-looking poster though:

## Philosophical perspective
I grappled a lot with the question of whether I wanted to medicate at all. This question is split over social issues and philosophical ones, but I want to start by addressing mental illness as a philosophical construct. What's the problem we're trying to solve, and what does a solution look like?

Of everything in this repo, this section is the least empirical and most opinionated. I happen to be entirely right, but you could probably imagine a world where someone disagrees with me -- or to go way out on a limb, where one of my opinions isn't the embodiment of absolute truth. Now _that's_ a scary thought.

## Social perspective
Bipolar complicates social interactions. Some of the difficulty improves with awareness and communication, but some has to do with fundamental conflicts that arise when someone is sufficiently inconsistent.
