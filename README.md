# Open source bipolar disorder
**Work in progress**

Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder -- and probably have for most of my adult life. That was a surprise and it kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which was straightforward. I'm writing this up as the thing I wished had existed as I was trying to figure it all out.

I've wanted to open-source the thought process around this problem for some time, but writing about it has been difficult. I feel like I spend a lot of time discovering that I have unresolved issues with some subtopic, usually after my writing devolves into an unconstructive polemic. This is probably the tenth iteration.

...so I'm not writing this from a place of authority or even competence. It's just stuff I found useful to read about, experiments I've tried, and my interpretations of the results.

With that said, though, DIY psychiatry has been a lot more fun and effective than I thought it would be so let's get right into it.

+ [Part 1: sources, pseudoscience, and alternative medicine](sources.md)
+ [Part 2: bipolar from the inside](inside.md) -- this has rough spots and you can skip it
+ [Part 3: defining the requirements](requirements.md)
+ [Part 4: neurotransmitters and metabolism](neurotransmitters.md)
+ [Part 5: index of relevant OTC supplements](supplements.md)
+ [Part 6: strategy and results](strategy.md)
+ [Part 7: postmortem and future changes](postmortem.md)

**TODO:** I want to create a simple "write me an email (e.g. to my employer) because I can't talk to people" thing. Not sure where to put it yet. I think it would ask a few questions and give you something you can copy/paste. Could be a question flow from generated markdown.


## Quick but important aside for alcohol users
I used to rely on alcohol to medicate anxiety -- as in, more than social drinking. This is a terrible strategy that causes brain damage and increases suicide risk.

**If this is you, [I have a whole page](alcohol-substitution.md) with some (in my opinion) much healthier and more effective alternatives that reduce OCD, may be neuroprotective, and mitigate suicide risk.** There are many safe OTC supplements that are shown to reduce addictive behavior, repair certain types of alcohol-induced brain damage, and provide comparable anxiolytic effects. I highly recommend reading about some of them before accepting alcohol as a solution to any problems or using it recreationally. [Go here!](alcohol-substitution.md)
