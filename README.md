# Open source bipolar disorder
Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder -- and probably have for most of my adult life. That was a surprise and it kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which was straightforward.

I've wanted to open-source the thought process around this problem for some time, but writing about it has been difficult. I feel like I spend a lot of time discovering that I have unresolved issues with some subtopic, usually after my writing devolves into an unconstructive polemic. I'm not uniformly knowledgeable about any aspect of mental disorders, resulting in narration that's either imbalanced or wrong.

...so you should understand that I'm writing about this as a DIY-inclined programmer and not as a medical expert. My goal was to solve my own mental health problems and I'm describing the process I took to get there, as well as my understanding of the reasoning behind it. As with everything I write, both are likely to have errors and/or involve tradeoffs that you shouldn't make. This is a journal, not a recommendation.

With that said, though, let's get into it because DIY psychiatry has been a lot more fun and effective than I thought it would be.


## Requirements (and why I'm DIYing this)
Bipolar disorder is normally treated with prescription mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate, lamotrigine (Lamictal), quetiapine (Seroquel), and probably others. There is no canonical treatment, I assume because bipolar has no consistent root cause.
