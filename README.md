# Open source bipolar disorder
Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder -- and probably have for most of my adult life. That was a surprise and it kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which was straightforward.

I've wanted to open-source the thought process around this problem for some time, but writing about it has been difficult. I feel like I spend a lot of time discovering that I have unresolved issues with some subtopic, usually after my writing devolves into an unconstructive polemic. I'm not uniformly knowledgeable about any aspect of mental disorders, resulting in narration that's either imbalanced or wrong.

...so I'm not writing this from a place of authority or even competence. It's just experimental outcomes and my interpretations of those results, which may or may not work the same way for you.

With that said, though, DIY psychiatry has been a lot more fun and effective than I thought it would be so let's get right into it. I will say that this story ends well even though it starts off kinda rough.


## Requirements for a treatment strategy
1. No adverse physiological side effects
2. No long-term neurodegeneration
3. No loss of mental function, especially for R+D work
4. No controlled substances: robust supply chains for everything, whether or not I have health insurance or a primary care practitioner (I currently have neither)

(1) rules out most prescription bipolar medications. (2) and (4) rule out trying to do something insane like cycling amphetamines to fight depression. (3) rules out prescription-strength lithium and most antipsychotics, and (4) really rules out anything that isn't OTC.


## Mental symptoms I wanted to fix
1. I would routinely start a project, have tons of energy for a couple of weeks, then crash hard and lose interest in almost everything. As time went on, I'd get these bursts less frequently and became less productive.
2. I was increasingly anxious about nothing in particular. It got to the point where I often wanted to leave my life behind and start over, I guess to get rid of something I assumed was causing my stress.
3. I was suicidal most days and often medicated with alcohol, which didn't really address the problem and likely made it worse over time. It was very difficult to hold down a full-time job in this state.
4. I was generally neither productive nor smart. I hadn't written anything worthwhile in a couple of years, nor did I have any plans to. I hadn't given up, but didn't see a way forward.


## Solving stuff
All credit goes to Joyce for getting me to realize I had a mental illness and pointing me in the right direction to begin to fix things. After much meandering and experimentation, I've concluded that most of my bipolar disorder came down to a few metabolic factors that could be addressed easily enough:

1. Lithium, magnesium, and B-vitamin deficiency caused by alcoholism and chronic stress
2. Folate deficiency caused by MTHFR C677T mutation and possibly light skin tone (I think melanin blocks folate oxidation from sunlight)
3. Antioxidant deficiency caused by excessive caffeine use and alcoholism
4. Chronic dopamine deficiency, possibly from excessive caffeine use and oxidative stress
5. Maybe thyroid deficiency; I'm not sure


### Current medication routine
I've been on this since about May/June 2020, so eight months as of this writing. The results have been fantastic. I'm alert, focused, consistently motivated, and low-anxiety almost all the time -- none of which I thought I would ever be able to achieve.

I've broadly classified these things by functional category, not by how they work physiologically. More details on this in below sections.

+ Morning
  + Neurotransmitter regulation
    + 20mg lithium aspartate
    + 96mg magnesium threonate (two capsules of MagMind)
  + Anxiolytics
    + 500mg theanine
    + 600mg ashwagandha
  + Stimulants
    + 10g tyrosine
    + 12-18g yerba mate tea
    + 6g ginkgo biloba + 6g bacopa monnieri + 6g gotu kola + 6g mint + 1g ginger root tea
  + Methylation and antioxidant support
    + 15mg-20mg methylfolate
    + 2.5mg methyl-B12
    + 2400mg long-release NAC
    + Vitamin C
  + General stuff
    + Iodine (+ tyrosine = T₃ and T₄)
    + 10-20g collagen peptides
+ Evening
  + 20mg lithium aspartate
  + 3g taurine (as magnesium taurate)
  + 1000mg tryptophan peptides
  + B-vitamin complex
  + Vitamin E
  + 1000mg theanine
+ Weekly
  + Selenium

I also consistently eat eggs and fish for breakfast, usually four eggs and 4-6oz of tuna or salmon. The choline isn't a problem, although eggs and fish keep me awake and I can't supplement alpha-GPC, citicholine, or ALA without getting really depressed.

I still have minor mood and energy cycling throughout the year, but nothing like before. Sometimes I'll try to course-correct; here are some of the options I'll use (usually a subset, not all of them):

+ If I've been sick or feel really bad (uncommon):
  + 10g glutamine (excitotoxicity risk)
  + 5-10-20mg DHEA (steroid-related risks)
+ If I'm depressed or sluggish (uncommon, maybe 1-3 days/quarter)
  + more ginkgo+bacopa tea
  + +5-10mg methylfolate
  + +48mg magnesium threonate
  + +5g tyrosine
+ If I'm anxious or jittery (more common, maybe 7-10 days/quarter)
  + Decrease tyrosine and collagen
  + +500-1000mg theanine as needed
  + +600mg ashwagandha
  + +3-5g taurine (without magnesium)
  + +500mg tryptophan peptides
  + +5-10mg methylfolate
  + +2.5mg methyl-B12
