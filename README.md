# Open source bipolar disorder
A pretty candid account of my experience with bipolar disorder: figuring out that it was a thing, managing it quasi-medically, reinterpreting past events with new context, and finding ways to socialize what mental illness is about and how to work with it. **This story ends well.**

I was on the fence about writing this up this way. You can see this especially in older revisions, but I'm still conflicted about parts of my own bipolar disorder despite knowing about it since 2019 and successfully medicating since late 2020. I'm also not used to putting my personal life on the internet as much as this repo does. There's a big difference between "[here's a cool project made from recycled garbage](https://github.com/spencertipping/www/blob/master/desk.md)" and "[here's the garbage I gave my wife and my coworkers for years and still regret](early-signs.md)". Those mistakes are worth owning but that doesn't make them easy to revisit; I sucked then, so why do I expect not to suck now or in the future? (And is medication the only reason? If so, what does that say about having integrity?)

Beyond catharsis, I decided to publish my experience because there aren't many people who have taken the DIY route on mental health. Given how often bipolar leads to medical noncompliance (which is dangerous from a substance abuse and suicide-management perspective), I want to document the thought process behind developing a self-medication strategy focused on OTC substances, and with the goal of long-term neuroprotection and high function in the immediate. I think this should be survival knowledge for anyone who may become medically noncompliant.

So let me know what you think about all this. I hope it's useful.

**Work in progress**


## The diagnosis problem
Bipolar is notoriously difficult to diagnose, on average requiring between five and ten years. It's often misdiagnosed as depression, I assume because people don't go to a psychiatrist for being too productive. Misdiagnosis ends up creating a bunch of other problems when it happens: antidepressants can cause mania to a larger degree than would otherwise occur (then followed by worse depression, etc).

To Joyce's credit, she suspected I had bipolar for a few years before we figured it out. I never fit the official symptom list that well, though. I suspect the diagnostic criteria are intentionally extreme to avoid false positives.

## Identifying with mental illness
_Oh shit, I have a mental illness. How much is real anymore? If my brain is broken, what can I assume?_

Turns out, quite a lot. All but the most extreme states of bipolar are confined to affective disruption, not altered reality. So feeling things that don't make sense in context, but they're still within the range of things most people would feel in certain situations. Concrete, conscious thought was pretty stable, if sometimes motivated by deranged frames of mind.

Bipolar is often described in terms of depressive, hypomanic, and manic states. Joyce found a summary chart from [bipolaruk.org](https://www.bipolaruk.org) that we've found helpful:

...and having been through most of this, I've found some YouTube clips from _The Office_ and James Bond that cover 0-9:

## Enzymes and neurotransmitters
As an engineer, I wasn't going to be living in a defective body without trying to fix stuff. Broken hardware is just an opportunity to figure out how it works and make it work better than it was designed to.

The first step was to stop trying to commit suicide so much. The biggest problem there was alcoholism:

Once that was sorted out I could make better progress on the cognitive end -- and there's a lot to that. Joyce had done some of the research into the MTHFR enzyme already; we knew I had the C677T variant from my 23AndMe profile. I started digging into neurotransmitters in general, encountering a wide variety of enzymes and cofactors. Here's a summary of that process, as well as some thoughts about sourcing and reliability:

+ [Neurotransmitters, enzymes, and cofactors](neurotransmitters.md)
+ [Sources and research](sources.md)

I understood bipolar to have neurodegenerative properties if left untreated, which was a forcing move to opt for medication. Then the question was, do I outsource to prescription meds or try for a DIY approach? Here's my thought process on that:
