# Open source bipolar disorder
**Work in progress**

Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder -- and probably have for most of my adult life. That was a surprise and it kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which was straightforward.

I've wanted to write about it ever since the diagnosis, but it's not an easy topic for me to address. The biggest obstacle isn't that I'm unwilling to talk about it; that's actually very easy for me. The hard part is maintaining enough emotional composure to discuss it without sounding like a lunatic. I spend most of my time being an engineer, which means (1) I'm not a great writer; and (2) I usually write about emotionally un-demanding things.

So this whole project is, in that sense, outside my comfort zone. Sorry in advance for the uneven quality.

As for why it exists, it's for the same reasons I write open-source software. Whenever I solve a hard problem, I want to publish the solution so others have more to work with. Like software, it isn't about finding _the_ solution, it's about finding _my_ solution -- which may be similar to others' or it may be completely different. The goal isn't necessarily to solve everyone's problems, it's to prove that similar problems are solvable and explain the process.

**This writeup is intentionally subjective.** Even when I don't phrase things that way, that's how I intend it. My main goal is to describe my experience, reasoning process, and how I relate to it all in hindsight -- and to preserve as much detail as I can. Not everyone with bipolar disorder will see things the same way, nor will many of my decisions make sense for other people. Like any open-source project, I welcome feedback. You can email me or file a github issue; I'll respond to both.

This writeup also covers some hard topics, plumbing the depths of depression and that sort of thing. I've tried to indicate ahead of time when you'll encounter these sections so you can skip over them, and where possible I've tried to provide lighter alternatives to make up any missing context. I don't think they're bad sections or poorly written -- given the topic it's some of my most balanced engineering prose -- but I think they'll be hard to read and they certainly aren't for everyone. If you read this writeup repeatedly and never touch some sections, I think that's appropriate; it's what I had in mind when writing it.

(If you clone the project locally, hard topics are in `heavy/`; everything else should be easy reading.)


## Quick links for people with immediate problems
**TODO:** revisit this

Open-source projects often have some short algorithm that solves a lot of unrelated problems. I ran across things like this when working around my bipolar disorder, and have dedicated pages for some of them so you don't have to encounter them by chance in the full writeup:

+ [How I used safer alternatives to help get past alcoholism](alcohol-substitution.md)
+ **TODO:** the "don't die" project of self-directed lectures to prevent suicide
+ **TODO:** the "email my manager" problem


## Part 1: what bipolar is, and why it's a problem
**TODO:** start this new sectioning

+ [Part 1: sources, pseudoscience, and alternative medicine](sources.md)
+ [Part 2: bipolar from the inside](heavy/inside.md) -- this has rough spots and you can skip it
+ [Part 3: defining the requirements](requirements.md)
+ [Part 4: neurotransmitters and metabolism](neurotransmitters.md)
+ [Part 5: index of relevant OTC supplements](supplements.md)
+ [Part 6: strategy and results](strategy.md)
+ [Part 7: postmortem and future changes](postmortem.md)

**TODO:** I want to create a simple "write me an email (e.g. to my employer) because I can't talk to people" thing. Not sure where to put it yet. I think it would ask a few questions and give you something you can copy/paste. Could be a question flow from generated markdown.
