# Open source bipolar disorder
**Work in progress**

Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder -- and probably have for most of my adult life. That was a surprise and it kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which was straightforward. I'm writing this up as the thing I wished had existed as I was trying to figure it all out.

I've wanted to open-source the thought process around this problem for some time, but writing about it has been difficult. I feel like I spend a lot of time discovering that I have unresolved issues with some subtopic, usually after my writing devolves into an unconstructive polemic. This is probably the tenth iteration.

...so I'm not writing this from a place of authority or even competence. It's just stuff I found useful to read about, experiments I've tried, and my interpretations of the results.

With that said, though, DIY psychiatry has been a lot more fun and effective than I thought it would be so let's get right into it.

+ [Part 6: postmortem and future changes](postmortem.md)

**TODO:** I want to create a simple "write me an email (e.g. to my employer) because I can't talk to people" thing. Not sure where to put it yet. I think it would ask a few questions and give you something you can copy/paste. Could be a question flow from generated markdown.

**TODO:** Write up a quick survival guide for people who newly have to deal with someone with depression/anxiety/mania/etc. I don't feel like this is well-explained in literature; it needs to be painted more empathetically, not using the clinical tone that often exists.


## Disordered moods from the inside: _The Office_ and James Bond
I've been from a 0 (depressed) to a 9/10 (manic) on the [UK bipolar mood scale](https://www.bipolaruk.org/FAQs/mood-scale) and found some clips that put characters into situations where they would feel the described mood state.

+ **Depressed (0):** [Scott's Tots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0N2ZxQJYTw) -- no exaggeration, and this is why people commit suicide when they're depressed
+ **Depressed (1):** [Diwali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTSg6vYJcxs) -- similar; with serious depression there's a strong feeling of having no control/influence that you can see here
+ **Depressed (2):** [The roast of Michael Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS-utbiLy6o)
+ **Depressed (3):** [Daycare interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMTxLRxiiC8)
+ **Euthymic (4):** [David Wallace in the hot tub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gYbZAAJtIE)
+ **Euthymic (5):** [Jim Halpert plays dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyWE-SmWp4)
+ **Euthymic (6):** [Bond drives a Ford and nothing exciting happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojob6IE4JQ4)
+ **Hypomanic (7):** [Bond has incredible luck (SNL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpibPm7AVE)
+ **Hypomanic (8):** [Drywall vs Daniel Craig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxNbAwY_rk)
+ **Manic/mixed manic (9):** same video but there's no bad guy; Bond just steals bulldozers because he feels like it


## Quick but important aside for alcohol users
I used to rely on alcohol to medicate anxiety -- as in, more than social drinking. This is a terrible strategy that causes brain damage and increases suicide risk.

**If this is you, [I have a whole page](alcohol-substitution.md) with some (in my opinion) much healthier and more effective alternatives that reduce OCD, may be neuroprotective, and mitigate suicide risk.** There are many safe OTC supplements that are shown to reduce addictive behavior, repair certain types of alcohol-induced brain damage, and provide comparable anxiolytic effects. I highly recommend reading about some of them before accepting alcohol as a solution to any problems or using it recreationally. [Go here!](alcohol-substitution.md)
