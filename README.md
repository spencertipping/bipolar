# Open source bipolar disorder
A pretty candid account of my experience with bipolar disorder: figuring out that it was a thing, managing it quasi-medically, reinterpreting past events with new context, and finding ways to socialize what mental illness is about and how to work with it. I sometimes generalize from my own experience in this writeup, and you should understand that to be speculation on my part. This story ends well.

I was on the fence about writing it up this way. You can see this especially in older revisions, but I'm still conflicted about parts of my own bipolar disorder despite knowing about it since 2019 and successfully medicating since late 2020. I'm also not used to putting my personal life on the internet as much as this repo does. There's a big difference between "[here's a cool project made from recycled garbage](https://github.com/spencertipping/www/blob/master/desk.md)" and "[here's the garbage I gave my wife and my coworkers for years and still regret](early-signs.md)". Those mistakes are worth owning but that doesn't make them easy to revisit; I sucked then, so why do I expect not to suck now or in the future? (And is medication the only reason? If so, what does that say about having integrity?)

Beyond catharsis, I decided to publish my experience because there aren't many people who have taken the DIY route on mental health. Given how often bipolar leads to medical noncompliance (which is dangerous from a substance abuse and suicide-management perspective), I want to document the thought process behind developing a self-medication strategy focused on OTC substances, and with the goal of long-term neuroprotection and high function in the immediate. I think this should be survival knowledge for anyone who may become medically noncompliant.

So let me know what you think about all this. I hope it's useful.

**Work in progress**


## Top-line issues
**If you're contemplating suicide or having an affair or other terrible decisions and don't have anyone to talk to, or don't want to talk to the people you do have, and you've heard that suicide hotlines are awful, which I've also heard but never verified:** email me and I'll reply. You can also join [https://dev.spencertipping.com](https://dev.spencertipping.com), which I'm happy to see expand into a forum for discussing mental illness. You wouldn't be the first person I've talked to for hours when they were considering suicide, and as someone who's considered it many times (and lost my mom to it) I have opinions about when it does and doesn't make sense.

**If you are using alcohol as a medication:** I did this too, it's very dangerous, and there are safer and more fun alternatives that don't result in hangovers or long-term brain damage. [I have a whole page about this.](alcohol-substitution.md)

**If you're using heroin as medication:** I haven't done this, but there is evidence that links heroin dependence to MTHFR enzyme impairments and elevated homocysteine ([source](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access-pdfs/methylene-tetra-hydrofolate-reductase-c677t-gene-polymorphism-in-heroin-dependence-2155-6105-1000226.pdf)), both of which can be addressed with over-the-counter methylfolate and methylated B12. I have the C677T mutation and it caused substantial depression before I started taking activated folate. See the methylation section on the [neurotransmitters page](neurotransmitters.md) for an explanation of why this happens.

**If a friend has told you they have bipolar and you're wondering what this means about interactions with them going forwards:** I have [a whole page about my take on this.](sensitivity.md)

Most of this repo isn't about being opinionated or offering specific advice, but those are a few topics where I think the right answer is obvious enough that I don't mind offering an opinion. I remember being mentally impaired enough that having someone state these things directly would have been helpful.


## The diagnosis problem
Bipolar is notoriously difficult to diagnose, on average requiring between five and ten years. It's often misdiagnosed as depression, I assume because people don't go to a psychiatrist for being too productive. Misdiagnosis ends up creating a bunch of other problems when it happens: antidepressants can cause mania to a larger degree than would otherwise occur (then followed by worse depression, etc).

To Joyce's credit, she suspected I had bipolar for a few years before we figured it out. I never fit the official symptom list that well, though. I suspect the diagnostic criteria are intentionally extreme to avoid false positives.

## Identifying with mental illness
_Oh shit, I have a mental illness. How much is real anymore? If my brain is broken, what can I assume?_

Turns out, quite a lot. All but the most extreme states of bipolar are confined to affective disruption, not altered reality. So feeling things that don't make sense in context, but they're still within the range of things most people would feel in certain situations. Concrete, conscious thought was pretty stable, if sometimes motivated by deranged frames of mind.

Bipolar is often described in terms of depressive, hypomanic, and manic states. Joyce found a summary chart from [bipolaruk.org](https://www.bipolaruk.org) that we've found helpful:

...and having been through most of this, I've found some YouTube clips from _The Office_ and James Bond that cover 0-9:

## Enzymes and neurotransmitters
As an engineer, I wasn't going to be living in a defective body without trying to fix stuff. Broken hardware is just an opportunity to figure out how it works and make it work better than it was designed to.

(By the way, I write this up like it was deliberate, linear process where I knew what I was doing. It wasn't. Joyce and I fumbled our way through all of this.)

The first step was to stop trying to commit suicide so much. The biggest problem there was alcoholism:

+ [Getting over alcoholism with OTC alternatives](alcohol-substitution.md)

Once that was sorted out I could make better progress on the cognitive end -- and there's a lot to that. Joyce had done some of the research into the MTHFR enzyme already; we knew I had the C677T variant from my 23AndMe profile. I started digging into neurotransmitters in general, encountering a wide variety of enzymes and cofactors. Here's a summary of that process, as well as some thoughts about sourcing and reliability:

+ [Neurotransmitters, enzymes, and cofactors](neurotransmitters.md)
+ [Sources and research](sources.md)


## Medication for the win
I understood bipolar to have neurodegenerative properties if left untreated, which was a forcing move to medicate. Then the question became, do I outsource to prescription meds and psychiatry or try a DIY approach? As someone who just cut a 4x4' hole in my living room floor to install a subterranean datacenter, I obviously opted for DIY. Here's my thought process:

+ [OTC psychoactive supplements, pharmacokinetics, and DIY quality control](supplements.md)
+ [My current medical strategy](strategy.md)


## The new hybrid
Turning me into a neurotypical person is probably beyond medical capability, but beyond that I'm not sure it would be valuable. My goal wasn't to erase bipolar, but to mitigate the problems it produced.

Not everyone will want to or be able to see it this way. It helps a lot that I can discuss mental health pretty openly with my coworkers ([Seeq](https://seeq.com) has been excellent across the board), so if I'm having an off-day I can say that and it isn't a big deal. The tech industry in general is willing to trade predictability for out-of-the-box thinking, which is a good fit for me. True to form, my consulting role with Seeq has converged to a mixture of weird off-timeline projects and fun debugging adventures. It's pretty awesome.

Since medicating I can reliably appreciate why I'm married with kids; there seems to be new/better hardware support for stable relationships. I still don't get jealousy or nepotism, but those seem like bugs not features. Individualism all the way.

Maybe the best part of post-medication life is that I can now execute long-term projects, one of which is a software company Joyce and I are starting together. She's also working through mental illness of her own, so we're taking a leisurely pace. That's also something that wasn't possible before.

A few other notable changes:

+ I perceive small positive things with much more fidelity: a sunny breeze, birds, that kind of thing. Elevated homocysteine had made all of this go away. I had forgotten how much I missed it.
+ I'm in a good mood basically every day -- like 95% of the time. I wake up and can count on feeling level and productive. And it's not depressed-productive, it's nearly-hypomanic-productive. Compared to before it's unreal.
+ I can write balanced prose now. Everything before wound up being a polemic by the time I was motivated enough to publish it, but now there's like nuance and stuff.
+ I don't have self-destructive habits like alcoholism, and I don't miss them. Upregulating GABA was better done by addressing nutritional deficiencies.
+ Because I'm biohacking all the time, I can modify stuff. On days when I do consulting work I increase tryptophan and decrease choline to be more sociable. Working solo is the opposite; I want to be more driven and intense.
+ I am never anxious anymore unless I've got a virus/infection/bug, which isn't very often. This is awesome.

I'm also collecting a very detailed profile of quantification data to monitor for further optimization down the line. I have a repo I'm going to publish soon that explains that project in the context of behavior and addiction management; I'll link it here when it's ready. Stay tuned.
