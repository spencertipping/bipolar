# Open source bipolar disorder
**Work in progress**

Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder -- and probably have for most of my adult life. That was a surprise and it kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which was straightforward. I'm writing this up as the thing I wished had existed as I was trying to figure it all out.

I've wanted to open-source the thought process around this problem for some time, but writing about it has been difficult. I feel like I spend a lot of time discovering that I have unresolved issues with some subtopic, usually after my writing devolves into an unconstructive polemic. This is probably the tenth iteration.

...so I'm not writing this from a place of authority or even competence. It's just stuff I found useful to read about, experiments I've tried, and my interpretations of the results.

With that said, though, DIY psychiatry has been a lot more fun and effective than I thought it would be so let's get right into it.

## Quick but important aside for alcohol users
I used to rely on alcohol to medicate anxiety -- as in, more than social drinking. This is a terrible strategy that causes brain damage and increases suicide risk.

**If this is you, [I have a whole page](alcohol-substitution.md) with some (in my opinion) much healthier and more effective alternatives that reduce OCD, may be neuroprotective, and mitigate suicide risk.** There are many safe OTC supplements that are shown to reduce addictive behavior, repair certain types of alcohol-induced brain damage, and provide comparable anxiolytic effects. I highly recommend reading about some of them before accepting alcohol as a solution to any problems or using it recreationally. [Go here!](alcohol-substitution.md)
