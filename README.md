# Open source bipolar disorder
**Work in progress**

**TODO:** trim down this intro

Early 2019 Joyce and I figured out that I have bipolar disorder. I probably have for most of my adult life, which was a surprise that kicked off a bunch of research and reflection, not all of which has been straightforward.

I've wanted to write about it ever since the diagnosis, but it's not an easy topic for me to address. The biggest obstacle isn't that I'm unwilling to talk about it; that's easy for me. The hard part is maintaining emotional composure while writing about parts of it that I haven't yet fully understood. And I'm always finding those topics on the fringe of what I try to document.

So this whole project is, in a big way, outside my comfort zone. Sorry in advance for the uneven quality.

As for why it exists, it's for the same reasons I write open-source software. Whenever I solve a hard problem and learn something, I want to publish the solution so others have more to work with. Different people will solve similar problems in different ways, but if more of those ways are explained then the world is easier to navigate.

Given that, **this writeup is intentionally subjective.** Even when I don't phrase things that way, that's how I intend it. My main goal is to describe my experience, reasoning process, and how I relate to it all in hindsight -- and to preserve as much detail as I can. Not everyone with bipolar disorder will see things the same way, nor will many of my decisions make sense for other people. Like any open-source project, I welcome feedback. You can email me or file a github issue; I'll respond to both.

This writeup also covers some hard topics, depression and that sort of thing. I've tried to indicate ahead of time when you'll encounter these sections so you can skip over them, and where possible I've tried to provide lighter alternatives to make up any missing context. I don't think they're bad sections or poorly written, but I think they aren't for everyone. If you read this writeup repeatedly and never touch some sections, I think that's appropriate; it's what I had in mind when writing it.

(If you clone the project locally, hard topics are in `heavy/`; everything else should be easy reading.)


## Medical perspective
In case it's unclear, I'm not a doctor and nothing I say is medical advice. I do have a medical-looking poster though:

...courtesy of [these guys](https://www.bipolaruk.org), and Joyce for finding it.
