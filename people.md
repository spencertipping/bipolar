# Dealing with bipolar people
...I mean fuck if I know.

But I can talk a bit about what my world looked like, which may provide some insight about the "why" behind mood disorders.


## What you're up against: _The Office_ and James Bond
A lot's been written about mania and depression, but nothing I've seen describes the subjective experience very well. I took a stupidly long time and collected a bunch of clips that capture the range I've been through, which goes from 0 (depressed) to 9/10 (manic) on the [UK bipolar mood scale](https://www.bipolaruk.org/FAQs/mood-scale).

When you're watching these, try to imagine how you would feel if you had just lived each scenario, then reality cut straight into a regular life situation. Mood disorders are exactly that: moods that don't make sense in the context you experience them.

### Why I chose these videos in particular
I wanted to keep the context small (just two shows) because I wanted the list to be accessible. Within that constraint, I wanted to capture both the progressing unrealism of extreme states and the continuum of control that happens as you go up the scale.


#### Depressive states
Starting on the low end, the biggest thing that I wanted to capture was the internal guilt and out-of-control feeling of depression. Scott's Tots is diabolically written; transpose the sense of failure onto being a dad and cut the video right before he gets up to say anything and you'll understand the fear that drives depressed people to commit suicide.

The big factors here are guilt and lack of control. In Scott's Tots, Michael is living with a reality that was made years ago; now he has to face the music. Diwali is similar in the reckoning it demands of Michael. Both cases are about a person who has failed themselves and are coming to terms with that reality. (Real-life depression is about feeling and believing this, whether or not it's materially the case.)

The roast and daycare are uncomfortable but a lot lighter. Michael flails during the roast; he's slow, inarticulate, out of his element, and despised by everyone. The evidence suggests that he's not a great guy, but he's standing up for himself (however ineffectively). He isn't being confronted with a failure as much as a bad reputation, which is less of an indictment.

I'm not totally sure about my placement of the daycare interview, but I put it there because it captures the "this is really uncomfortable even though it isn't that bad" aspect of mild depression. Social cues are off, molehills become mountains, everyone is insecure, and nobody wants to be there. I think this is a common social view of depression.


#### Euthymic states
(4) and (5) are more about what normal means to me. If you've seen the show, David Wallace is probably the most even-keeled character -- possibly too much to exemplify the low end of euthymia. But even level-headed, he's listless and unmotivated as he talks to Michael. It's more of an effectiveness problem than it is a mood problem.

(5) picks up from there: Jim is neither driven nor passive. Before I got myself straightened out I would have characterized this as a 6 or 7, but now I realize it's pretty average. It's easy to have fun and organize small stuff like this on a normal day.

(6) gets into "let's do stuff" territory. When I lean manic, I tend to become positively motivated and focused. Bond captures the intensity well. Bond in a Ford is realistic and grounded, but effortlessly cool. The dude's getting shit done and making it look easy.


#### Hypomanic states
I chose (7) because it captures the harmless chaos that starts to set in on the upswing. Bond isn't making terrible decisions, he's just losing himself too much to distraction. The problem is that _everything_ is interesting; he doesn't have a robust sense of perspective anymore. There's an analog of this state that's useful for R&D work because it's easy to brainstorm a bunch of scattered solutions without getting too invested in any of them. It's not great for getting focused work done though.

(8) sums up near-mania really well to me and I want to get into it point by point.

+ First, notice that Bond _feels_ very focused and driven. The rest of the scene calls this judgment into question; I'll explain in a moment.
+ Second, Bond behaves like someone who's nearly impervious to damage. Mania involves a lot of epinephrine and that's exactly what it feels like.
+ Third, Bond doesn't care how much damage he causes. This is also consistent. Damage and collateral are not an issue next to the objective, whatever that happens to be. This is kind of a caricature, but it's the emotional side of things for sure.

The big problem is that Bond is far too impaired to do his job effectively: he steals a bulldozer for no reason, attempts jumps he clearly has no ability to execute, and needlessly causes tens of thousands of dollars in property damage. This type of impaired judgment is also consistent with what I've experienced in mania (though obviously, I didn't make decisions that were this bad). I put this level of mania at about a dozen beers' worth of compromised judgment: short of a felony but well past the point of embarrassing oneself.

I want to mention again how accurate that clip is at depicting the physical aspect of mania. Strength and coordination are maxed out, minor injuries don't matter, anything in the way can be moved or destroyed. Fear is nonexistent. Energy and resourcefulness are ubiquitous: anything that can be imagined can be physically realized with minimal effort. Seriously, mania is as close as I can imagine to being superhuman -- I'm not at all surprised that people use meth.

By the way, this is also why empathy doesn't really work when manic: pursuing the objective is the top priority, and because you're effectively invincible, both emotionally and physically, it's hard to imagine what it would feel like to be any other way. Mania is every bit as all-encompassing as depression; it's hard to understand other frames of mind.

As for (9), I've only been seriously manic once. When it happened it was basically (8) with a lot less mental coherence. Everything seemed about the same -- I was incredibly driven and capable -- but I was convinced of two unreal things: (1) that my product idea was viable, and (2) that an unknown competitor was arbitrarily close to releasing a product that would destroy mine. I had no reason to believe either; it was all delusional thinking caused by some sort of chaotic feedback.
